Last week, the state House joined the state Senate in passing a bill that encourages children and school employees to turn in teachers who mention \"divisive concepts\" in their classrooms.\\nWBIR reports on the details. As for what Tennessee lawmakers consider to be \"divisive concepts,\" it's quite the hodgepodge, but it mostly boils down to mentioning racism or sexism in any way that might make a Tennessee Republican school or university student sad. WBIR gives a rundown of banned concepts, and the definition sandwiches no-brainer violations like teaching \"that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex\" with other, much weirder prohibitions like:\\n\\u2022 That a person, by virtue of their race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex\\n\\u2022 That a person should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish or another form of psychological distress because of their race or sex\\n\\u2022 That a meritocracy is inherently racist, sexist or designed by a particular race or sex to oppress members of another race or sex\\n\\u2022 That Tennessee or the U.S. is fundamentally or irredeemably racist or sexist\\n\\u2022 Promoting or advocating the violent overthrow of the U.S. government\\n\\u2022 Promoting division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class or class of people\\n\\u2022 Ascribing character traits, values, moral or ethical codes, privileges or beliefs to a race or sex, or to a person because of their race or sex\\n\\u2022 That the rule of law does not exist but instead is a series of power relationships and struggles among racial or other groups\\n\\nThis appears to mostly be a list of what state Republicans believe \"critical race theory\" might include, if anyone involved could be bothered to look it up, along with a specific prohibition on insulting the irredeemably racist-ass state of Tennessee, a clarification that you can endorse nonviolent overthrow of the United States government to students but not the violent kind, and a catch-all ban against \"promoting division between\" or \"resentment of\" a race, a sex, a religion, or the wealthy billionaire overlords who are murdering our planet for fun while buying themselves legislators willing to pass new laws saying nobody's allowed to promote any resentment towards them because of it.\\nThe bill passed last week, WBIR reports, is premised on \"strengthening\" a 2022 Republican bill already making those \"divisive concepts\" illegal, and it adds a few hooks to the existing law. State universities can't use state funds to support organizations that promote \"divisive concepts, and are now required to allow any guest speaker on campus regardless of \"non-violent political ideology.\" That requirement is an obvious nod to far-right white nationalist, white supremacist, and antisemitic speakers who have been having a harder time booking gigs now that those events have become notorious for instigating on-campus and near-campus violence.\\nYou might ask how that's going to work out if state universities are 1) required to allow violence-provokers like Jack Posobiec while simultaneously being 2) barred from using state funds to provide security for those events. That's a fine question, and the answer is there's no Republican currently in state office who knows or gives a damn.\\nThe whole bill speaks to a child's view of both free speech and education, but it's just so obviously tailored to curb classroom conversation about systemic racism while at the same time making fringe far-right speech mandatory if there's some performative book-selling jackass who needs a venue and can't convince any properties that aren\\u2019t state-owned to host him.\\nIt also fits neatly into that genre of Republican lawmaking that can be summarized as \"either this law is brazenly unconstitutional or it's a useless bit of posturing.\" That's the usual place that Republican bills aimed at intimidating teachers, universities, or everyday Americans end up, with language so intentionally broad that almost anything would appear to be a violation of the law, so long as just one conservative somewhere in the irredeemably racist state can claim to be offended by it.\\nIt's good to know that both of the Black Democrats who Republican lawmakers expelled from the House are back on the job, and immediately back to asking their Republican colleagues to explain themselves. Rep. John Ragan, who introduced the bill, appears to be what the kids today call an \"enormous f--kwit.\"\\nRep. Justin Jones (D\\u2014Nashville) spoke about the bill when he returned to the House of Representatives after he was expelled and reinstated. He asked a series of questions, such as whether \"college students are mature enough to talk about race and systemic racism, some of the concepts you want to prohibit being discussed at the college level?\"\\n\\n\"I believe in God. All else is settled by facts and data,\" Ragan said.\\n\\nI'm going to guess here that Ragan's educational background consists of writing \"God did it\" whenever one of his high school classes posed a test question he didn't know the answer to, coupled with a lot of yelling and threats of lawsuits aimed at any teacher who would try to flunk him for it. But that's just a guess. Maybe he's actually capable of answering questions about the bill he's advocating for, but is just so racist that he can't speak to his Black colleague. Hard to say.\\nJones was quite blunt in his evaluation of the \"racist\" law, and not just in pointing out that the bill would seem to plainly ban discussions of systemic racism. \"How will we be honest about our history if you're prohibiting any concepts about America's racist history? This sounds like fascism. This sounds like authoritarianism.\"\\nThe Republican push to ban \"divisive\" discussions of American racism past and present, new Florida prohibitions against university professors giving expert testimony that contradicts the governor's views, and book bans that have expanded into threats to close public libraries entirely rather than tolerate court rulings that return \"disputed\" books to the shelves: Yes, it all sounds like fascism. Republicans have lost every cultural war they've joined and have decided that it's democracy that's the problem, not them. And all of it is brazenly meant to be attacks on the rights of Black Americans, on other Americans of color, and on any Americans whose sexual identity is at odds with conservative \"beliefs\" about what it should be.\\nTennessee's Republican lawmakers continue to distinguish themselves as the most overtly racist little snots in government, however, and that is saying something. The state has a history of this stuff: Who could forget the now-infamous episode when Republican lawmakers stumbled on a janitor's mop sink inside House men's room and decided\\u2014because why not\\u2014that it was actually a \"Muslim foot bath\" and evidence that the Muslims were infiltrating the state capitol and having hygiene.\\nThat was 10 years ago. In the decade since, those Republicans have gone from anti-Muslim paranoia to pre-packaged \"critical race theory\" paranoia by way of a whole lot of racist paranoia in between. You'd think they'd want to at least zip it while national news cameras are looking them over, but no. These aren't people who can help themselves.\\n\\nRELATED STORIES:\\nTennessee state House speaker owns house outside his district, stiffs taxpayers on 236-mile commute \\nLeaked audio: Tennessee House Republicans are upset because they made themselves look 'racist' \\nTennessee Republicans claim they were 'obliged' to expel Democrats over peaceful protest \\n\\nIt's never too early to start talking about the House!

That might be the only thing that McCarthy\\u2019s fractious caucus can rally behind, however. Those cracks just keep getting wider, and the Freedom Caucus is prepared to blow it all up.\\nMcCarthy followed up on that speech in the weekly closed-door meeting of Republicans Tuesday, presenting to them what he wants to finally take to the table in negotiating a debt limit increase. \\nMeanwhile, the head of the Freedom Caucus, Texas Rep. Chip Roy, has been talking himself up to The Wall Street Journal, previewing how he is planning to continue to make McCarthy\\u2019s life hell. A WSJ reporter shadowed Roy last week, documenting how he is \\u201cpreparing for battle\\u201d over the debt ceiling.\\n\\u201cThe fight\\u2019s just begun\\u2014the speaker\\u2019s fight was a preview,\\u201d Roy told a group of Kerr County Republicans last week. \\u201cI\\u2019m not there to get second place. I\\u2019m there to win,\\u201d He reiterated that to the Kerr County Chamber of Commerce in another speech. \\u201cIf you think it was hot then, the debt-ceiling fight is going to get a lot hotter.\\u201d\\nRELATED STORY: Even Republicans are cringing at McCarthy's cruel budget proposal\\nJust to make his point clear, he later told the WSJ: \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to lose right-flank support if you don\\u2019t have upfront, first-year cuts.\\u201d He laid down his line in the sand. \\u201cThe debt ceiling is not going to be clean, and it\\u2019s not going to be one simple thing attached to it.\\u201d \\nMcCarthy\\u2019s proposal on the debt ceiling includes lots of cuts, a handful of repeals of President Joe Biden\\u2019s initiatives, and making all the working people who receive Medicaid and food stamp assistance prove that they are working. He reportedly doesn\\u2019t want to include some of the things the maniacs have been yelling about the loudest, like repealing the new IRS funding. \\nThat\\u2019s not going to go over well with the Freedom Caucus crowd, only four of whom McCarthy can afford to lose. He needs 218 votes and he\\u2019s not going to be getting them from any Democrats. There are already two Republicans who have told reporters that they won\\u2019t help McCarthy raise the debt ceiling, period. \\nAll that\\u2019s to remind McCarthy that he only holds the speaker\\u2019s gavel because Roy and team let him have it. And he\\u2019s increasingly growing short of allies. That\\u2019s McCarthy\\u2019s own fault since he\\u2019s been trash talking about his leadership team to anyone in the House who would listen. Despite his big talk, he\\u2019s not been able to pull the conference together on the big legislative agenda he promised for the first 100 days. It\\u2019s taken this long for him to even come up with an outline for a proposal on the debt ceiling.\\nAll this is creating \\u201cskepticism,\\u201d \\u201cdistrust,\\u201d and \\u201cgrowing rancor\\u201d in McCarthy\\u2019s gang, The Washington Post reports. And they have the receipts. \\u201cEverybody is going to be looking at each other much more suspiciously now,\\u201d an anonymous GOP told the Post. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be much harder to do things.\\u201d\\nStill, members who spoke to the Post tried valiantly to put a happy face on the situation. Like Majority Whip Tom Emmer, whose job it is to try to get 218 votes on anything from a group of people he admits \\u201cdespise each other.\\u201d\\n\\u201cYou may not want this person to get anything, and you are so sick and tired of this person taking everything,\\u201d Emmer told the Post. \\u201cOur job is to make sure that at the end of the day, both of them walk away from the table and go, \\u2018Yep, I did the job I had to do for the people at home.\\u2019\\u201d That\\u2019s an aspirational idea more than actual practice at this point, since they haven\\u2019t really been able to get any job done.\\nAnd how are the negotiations going? Roy is trashing his colleagues on the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which has been trying to figure out how to get a debt ceiling bill on the floor that could cobble enough votes from both parties to pass. Roy is having none of that. \\n\\u201cIf these sons-of-bitches want to try to end-run us, game on,\\u201d Roy said. So he\\u2019s nice.\\nThen there\\u2019s the question of whether the majority of these Republicans, McCarthy included, actually want to solve the immediate debt ceiling problem or whether they\\u2019re actively trying to crash the economy so they can blame it on Biden in 2024. \\nConsider this quote from a supposed \\u201cmoderate\\u201d in the conference: \\u201cI have said this all along,\\u201d said GOP Ohio Rep.

Fox contends that it was reporting newsworthy charges made by supporters of the Republican then-president and is supported legally by libel standards. After a\\xa0one-day delay\\xa0that raised the possibility of a last-minute settlement between the litigants, seating of the jury is scheduled to start Tuesday, followed immediately by opening statements.\\n___\\nCampaign Action\\nELECTION DISCONNECT\\nDenver-based Dominion has produced evidence that\\xa0prominent people at Fox didn't believe the fraud allegations, even as the network gave Trump\\u2019s allies airtime to repeat them. Multiple staffers texted and emailed in disbelief as Trump latched onto\\xa0increasingly tenuous claims\\xa0of being robbed by voter fraud. Fox\\u2019s Sean Hannity said in a deposition that he did not believe the fraud claims \\u201cfor one second\\u201d but wanted to give accusers the chance to produce evidence. Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, questioned under oath, agreed the 2020 election, won by Democrat Joe Biden, was\\xa0free and fair: \\u201cThe election was not stolen,\\u201d he said. Murdoch even wrote on Jan. 5, 2021, to a top executive urging that prominent Fox personalities issue a statement acknowledging Biden's legitimate win. At the same time, Murdoch\\xa0acknowledged\\xa0that Fox hosts such as Lou Dobbs and Jeanine Pirro at times endorsed false claims of election fraud.\\n___\\nFOX\\u2019S FEAR\\nThe court papers have laid out a\\xa0profound concern\\xa0at Fox over the impact of its election night call that\\xa0Biden had beaten Trump\\xa0in the battleground state of Arizona \\u2014 a call that was accurate. Fox scooped its rivals on the call, but it infuriated Trump and many Fox viewers, who expressed their anger and began tuning in to rival conservative media outlets such as Newsmax. Emails and memos released in the case show Fox executives were highly aware of a drop-off in their network's viewership at the same time that Newsmax was gaining viewers, and the executives viewed that dynamic as a potential threat.\\n___\\nLIBEL LAW\\nIn its defense, Fox has relied on a\\xa0doctrine of libel law, in place since a 1964 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, that has made it difficult for some plaintiffs to prove defamation by news outlets. Public figures, and Dominion fits that standard in this case, have to prove not only that the information reported was incorrect but that the news organization acted with \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d about whether it was true or not. Fox says Dominion can\\u2019t prove its case, but some First Amendment advocates suggest the voting machine company has a strong argument. Their worry is that a prolonged legal battle would give the Supreme Court a chance to change libel laws that would weaken protection for all the media.\\n___\\nJUDGE'S IRE\\nThe runup to the trial has been rocky for Fox, and not just because the public got a look at such private chatter as primetime host Tucker Carlson saying he\\xa0\\u201cpassionately\\u201d hated\\xa0Trump. The trial judge has scolded the network for 11th-hour disclosures about\\xa0Murdoch\\u2019s role at Fox News\\xa0and about some\\xa0evidence involving Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, including recordings of her talking off-camera with Trump\\u2019s lawyers. (Fox lawyers later apologized to the judge about the Murdoch matter, saying it was a misunderstanding not intended to deceive.) Fox, meanwhile, won some legal fights over limiting what jurors can hear, including a ruling that\\xa0bars testimony about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection\\xa0at the U.S. Capitol.\\n___\\nTRUMP\\u2019S INTEREST\\nTrump\\xa0has taken a keen interest in the case, judging by his social media posts. Always concerned about loyalty, and nursing a grudge about the Arizona call, he has expressed anger at revelations in the case that many people at Fox not only did not support his fraud allegations but privately disdained them. Trump had stepped up his criticism of Fox as the 2024 Republican presidential primary gained steam, but he\\xa0recently has given interviews\\xa0to Carlson and Hannity.\\n___\\nTHE ELECTION\\nFederal and state election officials,\\xa0exhaustive reviews\\xa0in multiple\\xa0battleground states\\xa0where\\xa0Trump challenged\\xa0his\\xa0loss, and\\xa0Trump\\u2019s attorney general\\xa0found\\xa0no widespread fraud\\xa0that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that\\xa0the vote\\xa0was tainted.

He said the publicity and the riots, the city\\u2019s $27 million settlement with Floyd\\u2019s family announced during jury selection, the unrest over a police killing of a Black man in a Minneapolis suburb during jury selection, and the sealing off of the courthouse, were just some of the factors prejudicing Chauvin\\u2019s chance of a fair trial.\\nHis appeal also focused on one juror who participated in a civil rights event commemorating the Rev.

Only after the trial did the juror reveal that he had been there.\\nBut the appeals court ruled that Cahill did not abuse his discretion in deciding those issues.\\nThe appeals court declined to address whether it was legally permissible to convict Chauvin of third-degree murder. The defense said a 2021 Minnesota Supreme Court decision\\xa0in a different police killing\\xa0case that clarified the definition of that crime meant the law no longer fit the facts of Floyd's killing.

Records produced as part of the lawsuit show that many of the network\\u2019s hosts and executives didn\\u2019t believe the allegations but aired them, anyway.\\nClaire Bischoff, a Dominion spokesperson, said the company would have no comment on the trial delay, as did Fox Corp., which is being sued along with Fox News. Representatives of the network did not return a request for comment.\\nIn his statement, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said only that the trial, including jury selection, would be continued until Tuesday and that he would announce the delay in court on Monday.\\nThat's when Fox News executives and the network's star hosts were scheduled to begin answering for their role in spreading doubt about the\\xa02020 presidential election\\xa0and creating the gaping wound that remains in\\xa0America's democracy.\\nJurors hearing\\xa0the $1.6 billion lawsuit filed against Fox by Dominion Voting Systems\\xa0would have to answer a specific question: Did Fox defame the voting machine company by airing bogus stories alleging that the election was rigged against then-President Donald Trump, even as many at the network privately doubted the false claims being pushed by Trump and his allies?\\nYet the broader context looms large.

It also would illuminate the flow of misinformation that helped spark\\xa0the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol\\xa0and continues to fuel\\xa0Trump's hopes to regain power in 2024.\\nFox News stars\\xa0Tucker Carlson\\xa0and\\xa0Sean Hannity\\xa0and founder\\xa0Rupert Murdoch\\xa0are among the people who had been expected to testify.\\nBarring a settlement, opening statements are now scheduled for Tuesday.\\n\\u201cThis is Christmas Eve for defamation scholars,\\u201d said RonNell Andersen Jones, a University of Utah law professor.\\nIf the trial were a sporting event, Fox News would be taking the field on a losing streak, with key players injured and having just alienated the referee.\\xa0Pretrial court rulings\\xa0and embarrassing revelations about its biggest names have Fox on its heels.\\nCourt papers released over the past two months show Fox executives, producers and personalities privately disbelieved Trump's claims of a fraudulent election. But Dominion says Fox News was\\xa0afraid of alienating its audience\\xa0with the truth, particularly after many viewers were angered by the network's decision to declare Democrat Joe Biden the winner in Arizona on election night in November 2020.\\nSome rulings by the judge have eased Dominion's path. In a summary judgment, Davis said it was\\xa0\\u201cCRYSTAL clear\\u201d\\xa0that fraud allegations against the company were false. That means trial time won't have to be spent disproving them at a time when millions of Republicans continue to doubt the 2020 results.\\nDavis said it also is clear that Dominion's reputation was damaged, but that it would be up to a jury to decide whether Fox acted with\\xa0\\u201cactual malice\\u201d\\xa0\\u2014 the legal standard \\u2014 and, if so, what that's worth financially.\\nFox witnesses would likely testify that they thought the allegations against Dominion were newsworthy, but Davis made it clear that's not a defense against defamation.\\nNew York law protects news outlets from defamation for expressions of opinion. But Davis methodically went through 20 different times on Fox when allegations against Dominion were discussed, ruling that all of them were fully or partly considered statements of fact, and fair game for a potential libel finding.\\n\\u201cA lawsuit is a little bit like hitting a home run,\\u201d said Cary Coglianese, law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \\u201cYou have to go through all of the bases to get there.\" The judge's rulings \"basically give Dominion a spot at third base, and all they have to do is come home to win it.\\u201d\\nBoth Fox and Dominion are incorporated in Delaware, though Fox News is headquartered in New York and Dominion is based in Denver.\\nFox angered Davis this past week when the judge said the network's\\xa0lawyers delayed producing evidence\\xa0and were not forthcoming in revealing\\xa0Murdoch's role at Fox News. A Fox lawyer, Blake Rohrbacher, sent a letter of apology to Davis on Friday, saying it was a misunderstanding and not an intention to deceive.\\nIt's not clear whether that would affect a trial. But it's generally not wise to have a judge wonder at the outset of a trial whether your side is telling the truth, particularly when truth is the central point of the case, Jones said.\\nThe lawsuit essentially comes down to whether Dominion can prove Fox acted with actual malice by putting something on the air knowing that it was false or acting with a \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d for whether it was true. In most libel cases, that is the most difficult hurdle for plaintiffs to get past.\\nDominion can point to many examples where Fox figures didn't believe the charges being made by Trump allies such as\\xa0Sidney Powell\\xa0and\\xa0Rudolph Giuliani. But Fox says many of those disbelievers were not in a position to decide when to air those allegations.\\n\\u201cWe think it\\u2019s essential for them to connect those dots,\\u201d Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said.\\nIf the case goes to trial, the jury will determine whether a powerful figure like Murdoch \\u2014 who\\xa0testified in a deposition\\xa0that he didn't believe the election-fraud charges \\u2014 had the influence to keep the accusations off the air.\\n\\u201cCredibility is always important in any trial in any case. But it\\u2019s going to be really important in this case,\\u201d said Jane Kirtley, director of the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and the Law at the University of Minnesota.\\nKirtley is concerned that the suit may eventually advance to the U.S. Supreme Court, which could use it as a pretext to weaken the actual malice standard that was set in a 1964 decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. That, she feels, would be disastrous for journalists.\\nDominion's lawsuit is being closely watched by another voting-technology company with\\xa0a separate but similar case\\xa0against Fox News. Florida-based Smartmatic has looked to some rulings and evidence in the Dominion case to try to enhance its own $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit in New York. The Smartmatic case isn\\u2019t yet ready for trial but has\\xa0survived Fox News\\u2019 effort\\xa0to get it tossed out.\\nMany experts are surprised Fox and Dominion have not reached an out-of-court settlement, though they can at any time. There's presumably a wide financial gulf. In court papers, Fox contends the $1.6 billion damages claim is a wild overestimate.\\nDominion's motivation may also be to inflict maximum embarrassment on Fox with the peek into the network's internal communications following the election.

One proposal empowers the secretary of state to order a redo election if they have \"good cause to believe\" that 2% of the county's polling places didn't have enough ballots\\u2014but it doesn't require hard proof of such problems, let alone whether they prevented enough people from voting to affect the outcome of the election.\\nTexas Republicans have undermined Harris County's voters for years.

Unlike the last two years, in which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was able to push through key elements of President Joe Biden's agenda with the help of a Democratic-led House, the Senate has been significantly slowed with Republicans now in charge in the House. And absences have made even simple votes like nominations more difficult.\\nOne immediate question for McConnell upon his return is whether to help Democrats temporarily replace Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee as she continues to recover in California from a case of the shingles. Democrats have become increasingly frustrated as the Democrat's more than six-week absence on the panel has stalled confirmation of some of Biden\\u2019s nominees, and Feinstein\\xa0has asked for a short-term substitute\\xa0on the committee.\\nDemocrats can\\u2019t do that, though,\\xa0without help from Republicans, since approval of the process would take 60 votes on the Senate floor. Republicans have so far been quiet about whether they will object.\\nIt is unclear when Feinstein, 89, will return to Washington. Her office has so far declined to say.\\nAlso returning to the Senate on Monday is Fetterman, who was hospitalized for clinical depression in February. He was treated for six weeks at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and his doctors say his depression is now \\u201cin remission.\\u201d\\nFetterman\\u2019s announcement that he was checking himself into the hospital earlier this year came after he suffered a stroke last year and has struggled with auditory processing disorder, which can render someone unable to speak fluidly and quickly process spoken conversation into meaning. The Pennsylvania Democrat, 53, now uses devices in conversations, meetings and congressional hearings that transcribe spoken words in real time.\\nIn a statement when he was\\xa0released from Walter Reed\\xa0late last month, Fetterman said the care he received there \\u201cchanged my life.\"\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m excited to be the father and husband I want to be, and the senator Pennsylvania deserves,\\u201d said Fetterman, who\\xa0won praise\\xa0for his decision to seek treatment.\\nWhen McConnell visited his Capitol office on Friday, video captured by NBC News showed him walking into the building without assistance as aides kept close by.\\nThis was the second major injury for McConnell in recent years. Four years ago he tripped and fell at his home in Kentucky, causing a shoulder fracture that required surgery.

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing1. What is affiliate marketing?\\xa0Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!2. What is an affiliate program?\\xa0An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?\\xa0\\xa0Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.\\xa0 Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?\\xa0Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\\xa05. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?\\n\\n\\xa0Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\\xa06. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?\\xa0Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.7. Where do I find qualified publishers?\\xa0The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?\\xa0An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\\xa09. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?\\xa0Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.10. What is a super affiliate?\\xa0A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.\\xa0 Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.11. How do we track publisher sales activity?\\xa0Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.\\xa012. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?\\xa0Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.13.

What is a commission rate?\\xa0Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.Who manages your affiliate program?\\xa0Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.18.

When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It\\u2019s like your computer\\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.\\xa0Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \\u201cBit Gold.\\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.So, What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Blockchain collects information in \\u201cblocks\\u201d.A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.Blocks form chains, which are called \\u201cBlockchains.\\u201dMore information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.Let\\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.How does blockchain work?Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.Here\\u2019s how it works:Someone or a computer will transactsThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.A network of computers can confirm the transaction.When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a blockThe blocks are linked together to create a history.And that\\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.How are Blockchains used?Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.What is Blockchain Decentralization?Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \\u201cDecentralization,\\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.Pros and Cons of BlockchainBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.\\xa0ProsAccuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.Safe, private, and easy transactionsProvides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal informationConsData storage has limits.The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.It has a risk of being used for illicit activities\\xa0Frequently Asked Questions About BlockchainI\\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.What is the most prominent blockchain company?Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.Who owns Blockchain?Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency\\xa0What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.Final SayingBlockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.1) What is an NFT?NFT stands for non-fungible\\xa0 token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.2) What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.3) What makes an NFT valuable?\\n\\nThe value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.4) How do NFTs work?One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.\\xa0As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.\\xa0NFTs also contain smart contracts\\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.5) What\\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.10) How do we buy an NFTs?There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.11) Can i mint NFT for free?To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?\\n\\xa0Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.Final SayingThat\\u2019s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening.

Why is email marketing important?Email is the marketing tool that helps you\\xa0 create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak\\xa0 to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.2. What is benefits of email marketing?Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:Better brand recognitionStatistics of what works bestMore salesTargeted audienceMore traffic to your products/services/newsletterBuild credibilityMost\\xa0 bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be\\xa0 times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your\\xa0 data to decide.\\xa04. Which metrics should I be looking at?The two most important metrics for email marketing are\\xa0 open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.5. How do I write a decent subject line?The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing\\xa0 the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for\\xa0 A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and\\xa0 simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,\\xa0 then repeated\\xa0 at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.\\n6. Is email marketing still effective?Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site\\xa0 hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans\\xa0 see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely\\xa0 see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.\\n7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?Buying an email list is\\xa0 waste of time & money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.\\xa0Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.\\n8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?If the\\xa0 subject line of the email is irrelevant to\\xa0 customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus\\xa0 on sales, offers and discounts.\\xa0Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to\\xa0 connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.\\xa0Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are\\xa0 your emails will soon be diverted to\\xa0 spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.10. Where can I find email template?Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.\\xa0However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.\\xa011. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?Is it a trend to listen to\\xa0 and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs.

It has quietly lowered the price for the Model 3, so that the the rear-wheel drive variant now starts at $39,990 or $2,000 less than what buyers would pay for it as recently as earlier this month. If you'll recall, the automaker already cut $1,000 off its price and started selling it for $41,990 the last time it implemented price cuts just a couple of weeks ago. And earlier this year, Tesla cut its prices quite drastically across its lineup, with some models getting a price drop of as much as 20 percent.As Tesla notes on its website, though, the rear-wheel drive model now only qualifies for $3,750 in tax credits after the government's change in guidelines took effect on April 18th. The new rules are related to the US cutting off China as an approved trading partner, which would lead to EVs using China-made batteries losing tax credits as a result. To note, Tesla's other cars are still eligible for the full $7,500 tax credits, including the Model Y vehicles that also got a price cut.\\xa0The base, the Long Range and the Performance Model Y vehicles now cost $3,000 less than before. The base Model Y will now set buyers back $46,990, while the Long Range and Performance vehicles now cost $49,990 and $53,990, respectively. When Tesla reported its earnings for 2022 in January this year, Elon Musk said the company was seeing orders \"almost twice the rate of production.\" According to Bloomberg, though, Tesla was unable to sustain that rate of demand and has made the lowest number of deliveries in the first quarter of this year since 2021. Since the company reportedly produced thousands of vehicles more than it handed over to customers, these price cuts were likely implemented to sell existing inventory and to drum up demand going forward.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/teslas-latest-price-cut-brings-model-3-pricing-below-40000-071124983.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/teslas-latest-price-cut-brings-model-3-pricing-below-40000-071124983.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:11:24 +0000", "image_url": null}, {"title": "Netflix is about to crack down on account sharing in the US", "description": "Netflix is about to bring its fight against account sharing to the US. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn Q1, we launched paid sharing in four countries and are pleased with the results,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the company wrote in its Q1 letter to shareholders. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are planning on a broad rollout, including in the US, in Q2.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSince February, Netflix has offered paid account sharing in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain. The add-on allows primary account holders to pay an additional fee every month to share their Netflix service with up to two people outside of their household.

The company has revealed that it will \"wind down\" DVD rentals (that is. DVD.com), with its last movie discs mailing on September 29th. Simply put, the shrinking demand for physical rentals is making it \"increasingly difficult\" to offer the quality of service the company wants.Netflix shipped its first disc (Beetlejuice, if you're curious) in 1998. It has since mailed over 5.2 billion movies in its signature envelopes (nearly all of them before 2019) to more than 40 million customers. You likely know the story after that. The company began streaming on-demand video in 2007, and that business grew quickly enough that it became Netflix's most popular offering by 2009. After a premature attempt to spin off the mailed rentals as Qwikster in 2011, Netflix moved them to DVD.com in 2016. By that point, the company was well into producing original streaming shows and had stopped mailing DVDs on Saturdays.There's also a financial incentive to drop disc rentals. While Netflix is recovering from a bleak 2022, its profits in the first quarter were still worse than they were a year ago. Subscriber growth was relatively modest, too, at 1.7 million new users. A decision to axe the DVD-by-mail unit could help Netflix trim costs, even if the savings are relatively small. The disc market has been on a sharp and steady decline for years, according to VideoScan/MediaPlayNews data \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sales alone dropped 19 percent from 2021 to 2022.It's nonetheless a sad moment for home video fans. Netflix played a major role in shaking up the movie rental business. Where retailers like Blockbuster dominated in the 1990s and early 2000s, Netflix helped people stay at home. Blockbuster and other rivals hopped into the market years later but fought to gain traction. While retail rentals are still available through Redbox kiosks and similar options, it's safe to say Netflix changed expectations for good.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-shut-down-its-dvd-rental-business-in-september-195213827.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-shut-down-its-dvd-rental-business-in-september-195213827.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 19:52:13 +0000", "image_url": null}, {"title": "Meta's Horizon Worlds is opening to young teens in the US and Canada", "description": "Months later than rumored, Meta's Horizon Worlds is opening its doors to younger teens. The company is making its metaverse space accessible to teens aged 13 to 17 in the US and Canada in the weeks ahead.  Unsurprisingly, the company is promising \"robust\" safety measures and parental controls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it wants to be sure the experience is age-appropriate, and the gradual rollout will help it gauge how well those protections are working.Teens' Horizon Worlds profiles will be private by default, and won't automatically show locations or active statuses. They won't see unfamiliar adults in their \"people you might know\" lists. Age ratings prevent teens from creating or using mature content, and a \"voice mode\" garbles the voices of anyone that isn't following back. These younger users will also get safety tips while they're in VR.\\xa0Parents can use the Meta Quest app or Family Center (now available for Horizon Worlds) to control features like personal boundaries. They can also allow or block apps, track usage and see who's following who. All users can cast their VR view to an external screen, so a parent in the room can see what's happening.The strategy closely reflects Meta's approach to teen safety on Facebook and Instagram. That won't necessarily please everyone. Senators have urged Meta to keep teens off Horizon Worlds over concerns the company's safeguards may be inadequate. They've noted that Meta's own research revealed harm to some teens, and that other virtual spaces like VRChat are prone to predatory and toxic behavior.There's plenty of pressure on Meta to expand, however. The social media giant has struggled to pivot to the metaverse, and continues to lose billions investing in the Reality Labs unit behind Horizon Worlds and Quest headsets. A wider teen audience could boost Horizon's audience and spur the market for VR hardware.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-horizon-worlds-is-opening-to-young-teens-in-the-us-and-canada-194600914.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/metas-horizon-worlds-is-opening-to-young-teens-in-the-us-and-canada-194600914.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 19:46:00 +0000", "image_url": null}, {"title": "Latest Apple headset rumors say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll include VR workouts and sports", "description": "Apple is reportedly readying a wide array of apps and services for its upcoming mixed reality headset, according toBloomberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mark Gurman. The company appears to be moving forward with plans to announce its first VR / AR headset at its Worldwide Developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Conference in June.The Apple mixed reality headset (rumored to be named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReality One\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReality Pro\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) can allegedly switch between virtual and augmented reality. It will focus heavily on gaming, fitness, sports and collaboration tools. Customers who buy the device can use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmillions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of existing apps in the headset\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 3D interface \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith slight modifications\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from developers. Additionally, Apple has reportedly been working with \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca small number of developers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for months to optimize apps for the new product. Announcing the device months before its launch should also give other developers time to create new apps or adapt existing ones for its futuristic interface.Although many of the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s details have leaked before, a new morsel in this report is its ability to run Apple Fitness+ workouts in VR. (Imagine a virtual workout where you feel like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the same space as the instructor.) In addition, it will allegedly support immersive sports viewing, leveraging the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s streaming rights for Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball, as well as its 2020 purchase of VR sports startup NextVR. Likewise, the Apple TV app will let you watch videos in virtual environments like a desert or the sky.The report says the headset will have a productivity focus, similar to the Meta Quest Pro. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe platform will support its Pages word processing, Numbers spreadsheet and Keynote slide deck apps, as well as iMovie and GarageBand for video and music production,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d writes Gurman. It would also prioritize communication and remote collaboration, letting users see full-body 3D avatars of people they're talking with in FaceTime calls. Gaming will also be a primary focus. However, that wasn't always the case, as today's report says that Apple previously wasn't putting as much attention into that space.Gurman also reiterates earlier reporting about the headset, including a Digital Crown like the one on the Apple Watch and AirPods Max headphones that lets you switch between VR (fully immersive, no real-world view) and AR (using cameras to combine your real environment and virtual elements). It would support running multiple apps simultaneously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloating within the mixed-reality interface.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It could also remember where you were in your physical environment, leaving virtual elements in the same spot you left them. (We saw that feature as far back as the first HoloLens developer kit in 2016.)The headset would also let you control it with eye gestures that determine where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking and hand gestures like finger pinches to select items and navigate menus. In addition, it will have an in-air virtual keyboard and support physical keyboards for a more tactile typing experience. Its home screen could appear similar to the iPad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s familiar Control Center for toggling things like WiFi, Bluetooth and volume. Finally, it will support Siri voice control and use eye scans for security, acting as the device\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equivalent to Face ID and Touch ID.Although the product will supply a robust feature set that will elicit curiosity, other companies have tried similar things but have yet to succeed. For example, although the cheaper Meta Quest VR headsets have done reasonably well as gaming devices, the more expensive Meta Quest Pro \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with a similar mixed reality focus and productivity apps \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been a tougher sell to consumers. And Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s version will reportedly cost around three times as much \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a staggering $3,000. On the other hand, Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history requires us to keep a somewhat open mind: There were MP3 players before the iPod, smartphones before the iPhone and smartwatches before the Apple Watch. Those competing devices all had similar features but failed to capture the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imagination in the same way as Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stylish and user-friendly variants.Even if the product targets a niche audience, it could serve a purpose as a consumer-facing transition product pointing toward an eventual pair of AR glasses that passes for a regular pair of prescription frames. Seen by many in the industry as the holy grail of mixed reality, such a device could be worn all day out in the world, while the upcoming mixed reality headset expected in June would not.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/latest-apple-headset-rumors-say-itll-include-vr-workouts-and-sports-192316389.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/latest-apple-headset-rumors-say-itll-include-vr-workouts-and-sports-192316389.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 19:23:16 +0000", "image_url": null}, {"title": "Designing for a better future: Framlab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision for urban architecture", "description": "When it comes to sustainability, cities represent both the problem and the solution.

To that end, Reddit is introducing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew premium access point for third parties,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the company said in an official announcement.

To mark the occasion, the company has revealed just how many units players have bought to date. Panic says it has sold 53,142 Playdates so far. That's more than two and a half times the number of units the company initially expected to make.When Panic opened pre-orders in mid-2021, it wasn't certain whether it would sell the first batch of 20,000 consoles at a reasonable pace. Eager customers snapped all of those within 20 minutes.While there is clearly a demand for the console with a crank, getting the Playdate into players' hands has been a tricker problem. Panic came across a \"critical\" battery issue while manufacturing the first batch, leading it to switch suppliers and delay the console from late 2021 into 2022.Not only have parts shortages slowed down deliveries, manufacturing costs forced Panic to increase the price of the Playdate by $20 to $199 earlier this month. Panic has shipped more than 27,000 Playdates and it expects to fulfill all preorders by the end of 2023. After that, it hopes to make Playdate available on an ad-hoc basis and to finally start shipping the Playdate Stereo Dock.Every Playdate user gets access to a library of 24 games, while there are more than 400 titles available for the console on Itch.io. Panic says almost 40 percent of users have sideloaded at least one game or app. Meanwhile, the company recently rolled out Catalog, a built-in store.

The shadowy organization was introduced in the beloved 1990s series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, as a foil for Starfleet, testing the boundaries of the idealism depicted in the future world of Star Trek. Since then, it has popped up in most modern Trek installments, including the animated Star Trek: Lower Decks and in movies like Star Trek: Into Darkness.Star Trek: Section 31 joins multiple forthcoming Trek projects, such as that just-announced Starfleet Academy show and upcoming seasons of Star Trek: Prodigy, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Star Trek: Lower Decks. Star Trek: Picard finishes its three-season run this week and Star Trek: Discovery returns for a final season sometime next year.

The company will also restrict informative and artistic videos containing disorders (such as someone discussing their recovery) to users 18 and older.You'll also see crisis resource panels for eating disorders in more places. While they already appear in search results in nine countries (including the US, Canada and UK), you'll now see them underneath relevant videos in those areas.

YouTube says this is an \"ongoing\" effort.The addition is an acknowledgment that videos can affect people in \"different ways,\" YouTube says. Ideally, this will minimize the chances of helpful video creators inadvertently fostering eating disorders in at-risk viewers.Whether or not this works as intended is another matter. YouTube's enforcement hasn't always been consistent, and it has occasionally had to reverse policies (such as one limiting profanity in monetized videos) that inadvertently punished certain creators. Gaming and LGBTQ video producers, for instance, have complained that YouTube has demonetized clips that aren't harmful.

But sometimes, a deal pops up that makes such decisions much more straightforward. Right now, you can snap up Apple's 2022 iPad Air for just $500. That's $100 off and the lowest price we've seen for the tablet all year. Amazon lists the device for $559, but it's currently applying a $59 coupon at checkout.The deal is valid on all colors, including blue, purple, pink, starlight and space gray. It's for a WiFi-only model with 64GB of storage. Of note, this iPad Air has Apple's M1 chip. Combined with the lower price, that may make the Air a more compelling option than the regular iPad, which also has a 10.9-inch screen but a less-advanced A14 Bionic chip (that device currently starts at $449).The iPad Air comes with a 12MP wide camera and a 12MP front-facing camera that supports Apple's Center Stage feature. This harnesses machine learning to detect your head and keep it centered in the frame during your FaceTime calls.We gave the latest iPad Air a score of 90 in our review, lauding it for the M1-powered zippiness, upgraded camera and battery life (it lasted for up to 12 hours between charges in our testing). We remain fans of the design and build quality as well.On the downside, Apple stuck with Touch ID instead of incorporating Face ID, while the base storage of 64GB isn't a lot to work with these days. Plus, be prepared to shell out quite a bit if you want to use Apple's official keyboard or the Apple Pencil. On the whole, though, the Air is perhaps the best iPad option for most folks right now, especially bearing in mind the solid discount.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-2022-ipad-air-is-back-on-sale-for-500-155033771.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-2022-ipad-air-is-back-on-sale-for-500-155033771.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:50:33 +0000", "image_url": null}, {"title": "Breville Pizzaiolo review: A pricey pizza oven with lots of options", "description": "A few months ago, it seemed like every cooking account I followed on Instagram was using a Pizzaiolo. I stumbled upon Breville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dedicated pizza oven a while ago at the suggestion of a colleague, but it was a bit outside of our coverage area to review. Now that we have an annual week of kitchen-focused reviews, buyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guides and how-tos, it was time to finally put a Pizzaiolo through its paces for this website.Breville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pizzaiolo may look a bit like its toaster ovens, but the larger unit is designed for one thing: pizza. From handy presets to a full manual mode for advanced users, this oven offers just about anything you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so long as your pizzas are round and 12-inches or smaller. But even with all of its cooking chops, is the Pizzaiolo worth the nearly $1,000 price tag? Or perhaps the better question is: Do you really need a dedicated pizza oven inside your house?DesignPhoto by Billy Steele/EngadgetThe Pizzaiolo looks like many other Breville countertop appliances. Available in stainless steel and black finishes, the pizza oven has a design akin to the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s multi-function toaster ovens and air fryers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely the Smart Oven line. At 18.1 x 18.5 inches though, the Pizzaiolo is much bigger than all of those compact kitchen accessories. Like Breville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Smart Oven lineup, this pizza-focused model has a silver door handle up top, though the one here is more robust than what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the smaller ovens. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a wide viewing window that allows you to observe the cooking area from edge to edge.All of the controls are on the front, situated at the bottom right. Two large main dials control the timer and style presets while a tiny third selector lets you adjust the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDarkness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or power of the top heating element. There are also two lights: one to indicate you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in manual mode and one that glows when the oven has reached your desired temperature and blinks slowly while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  preheating. Manual mode lets you control the temperature of both the top and bottom heating elements independently, rather than relying on Breville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style presets. The company includes a magnet that lays over the time numbers and preset labels so you know what temps you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve chosen for manual mode.Inside, the 12-inch cooking area is a round stone that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite go all the way to the sides of the cooking area. The Pizzaiolo has reflectors around the baking stone that send heat from the top heating element to the crust. This means you can only use the oven for pizza or things baked in smaller round pans since there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any extra room to work with. There also isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an interior light to help you see how things are progressing. However, Breville says the radiant heat is controlled by the oven so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to worry about rotating pizzas for even cooking. Lastly, the deck that holds the stone is connected to the door, so when you open it, the cooking surface moves closer to you. This makes launching and removing pizzas slightly easier.Setup and usePhoto by Billy Steele/EngadgetBefore you use the Pizzaiolo for the first time, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to wipe down the inside and the top of the stone with a damp cloth or sponge. Once everything is dry, you have to run the oven wide open at 750 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes to season it. When the time is up, the Pizzaiolo is ready to cook your first pie. By default, the style selector picks all of the oven settings for you, so you make the choice there first and the recommended time will show on the other dial automatically. Of course, you can adjust this as needed.Depending on the style and temperature, Breville says the preheating process can take up to 20 minutes. I only timed this on the hottest possible option \\xe2\\x80\\x93 750 degrees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 since it would take the longest. The Pizzaiolo took 17 minutes to reach that number. When you turn the oven off, the fan will run for another 15 minutes to cool the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csensitive electronics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dOne thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice about the Pizzaiolo is that the outside stays relatively cool during the cooking process. Breville says this is due to the double-pane front window and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmulti-material insulation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that keeps as much of the heat inside as possible. Indeed, the top stays cool to the touch when in use, but the bottom of the sides where the vents are located and the door (not the handle) get hot.The only issue I had was a small fire from excess semolina on the bottom of one pie. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a big deal as it went out quickly and wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all that big, but it left a mess on the stone I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to put another pizza on top of. With outdoor ovens from Ooni, for example, this would just burn off and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d use a brush to push the extra burned bits to the side or rake them to the front.On the Pizzaiolo, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nowhere to brush any debris as the opening around the stone goes underneath it where the heating element resides. The fact that the cooking deck is attached to the door also makes sweeping out any bits difficult. Even when the oven is off the inside is awkward to clean since the interior isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very tall. In a few spots, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to see the grime you might\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve missed.Making the pizzaOoni's classic pizza dough recipe cooked on the \"Wood Fired\" preset.Photo by Billy Steele/EngadgetBreville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presets come in handy when you just want to make good pizza and not worry about the exact numbers for time and temp. As promised, the full-heat and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWood Fired\\xe2\\x80\\x9d options produce the leoparding that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desired for Neapolitan-style pizza. The former option also adjusts the top heating element so that just the outer crust is getting direct heat during baking (pictured in the gallery below). I was also impressed by the even cooking on the New York setting, where the crust and toppings were evenly cooked but there was still a pleasant chewiness to the bite.Perhaps the biggest surprise was the Frozen option, which puts the stone at 425-475 degrees and the top at 350-400 with even heat for the Darkness. In full disclosure, I splurged on Newman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Own stone-fired pizzas which are supposedly imported from Italy, but the results were seriously impressive. The Pizzaiolo also did well on thin cauliflower crust pies from Milton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a Steele family favorite.The competitionAn alternative to the Pizzaiolo is the Ooni Volt 12. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much larger than the Breville pizza oven, but it does have a square stone that gives you a bit more versatility. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also an interior light that stays on the whole time so you can see clearly what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening inside. The Volt 12 looks a lot like Ooni\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent outdoor ovens with completely manual controls that give you the ability to select an exact temperature and manage the balance between the top and bottom heating elements. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, Ooni includes a boost feature that can get the stone back to your desired temp in about 45 seconds. Like the Pizzaiolo, though, the big downside is cost as the Volt 12 is $999.Wrap-upYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a dedicated pizza oven to make great pizza at home. With some affordable accessories like a baking stone or steel, you can cook excellent pies inside the main oven in your kitchen. There are also tons of more affordable wood- and gas-burning outdoor options. Breville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pizzaiolo does offer a lot of tools for cooking pizza, from the convenient presets to the full manual mode for endlessly adjusting the variables.

And that's precisely what makes it so much fun. The new Peacock series from Tara Hernandez (The Big Bang Theory) and Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers), pits a nun with a mysterious past against an all-powerful, seemingly omniscient artificial intelligence. Her mission: to find the Holy Grail. You know, another one of those stories. Along the way, there are a slew of messy beheadings, a cheesy '90s-era car chase and a group of villainous German henchman spiritually descended from The Big Lebowski's trio of Nihilists.If you were looking for another complex genre exercise like Lindelof's excellent Watchmen series or The Leftovers, Mrs. Davis ain't it. But from the first scene of the show, you can tell that he probably had a lot more fun making this. Initially based on a spec script by Hernandez, who also served as showrunner, Mrs. Davis is practically a live-action cartoon, filled with colorful set-pieces and a never-ending slew of zany characters, all set in a world where humans willingly subject themselves to the demands of an AI via wireless earbuds.None of Mrs. Davis would work without Betty Gilpin (GLOW, The Hunt) as its heart and soul. As Simone, the nun being targeted by Mrs. Davis, she effectively juggles a hard-edged cynicism with an openness to pure devotion. It's hard enough to be a believable action lead, it's even tougher to make that same character seem believably devout. By the time we see Simone racing through city streets on a motorcycle, while also wearing her nun habit, we fully buy Gilpin in the role. It's like seeing Kill Bill's The Bride with a samurai sword \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it's sure to be an indelible pop cultural image. (And of course, it hearkens back to Abel Ferrara's cult revenge classic, Ms. 45.)As a piece of cultural commentary, Mrs. Davis is practically allergic to subtext. It's a nun versus AI, what else do you need? It's easy to draw parallels between religious devotion and the way we live with technology today. That's particularly true when it comes to the explosive rise of generative AI. Is there really a huge difference between plugging in a string into ChatGPT or Midjourney and hoping for an interesting result, compared to putting your hands together and praying for divine help? And if AI ultimately ends up fulfilling our needs more effectively, wouldn't people treat it with a certain amount of religious reverence?These questions danced around my head as I watched Mrs. Davis, but the series itself is far more interested in goofy shenanigans and soapy plot twists than attempting any serious philosophical exploration. But I suppose even Damon Lindelof needs a vacation sometimes. Your enjoyment of the show will depend on well you sync up with its farcical wavelength. Why is there a group of well-funded, anti-AI militia bros, led by a shirtless buffoon? Don't worry about it, they're hilarious (Chris Diamantopoulos, one of the more memorable VC bros from HBO's Silicon Valley, truly commits.)The idea for Mrs. Davis arrived in the early paranoid phase of the pandemic, Lindelof told us in an interview. During that time of sheer uncertainty \\xe2\\x80\\x94 back when we were still wiping down groceries \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Hernandez wished for an app that could just tell her what to do. \"What if there was something that we trusted?\" Lindelof said. He was also intrigued by the role of algorithms in our lives, something he noticed while going down YouTube and Tiktok rabbit holes with his teenage son.Mrs. Davis was written and produced long before ChatGPT and other generative AI tools reached the public, but its release couldn't be better timed. Despite just making a show about an all-powerful algorithm, Lindelof is intrigued by the new AI tools. \"Artificial intelligence is basically coded to give us what we want,\" he said. \"And so, never before in the history of of technology have we had more of an opportunity to get clarity on what it is we want.... What is human existence? What is the meaning of life?\"PeacockIf Mrs. Davis more effectively wrestled with those questions, it would have been another prestigious series for Lindelof. Instead, it feels more like a creative exercise, one that gave Hernandez the opportunity to move beyond the world of sitcoms.\\xa0\\xa0\"I think that we we have an unprecedented opportunity for the greatest therapist in the history of of of our species to tell us, here's what you really are like,\" he added. \"For any fan of Douglas Adams,  we now have that computer that's going to spit out \"42\" [Adams' comedic answer to the meaning of life].  I'm just curious to see what it says.\"The first four episodes of Mrs. Davis premiere on Peacock on April 20th.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:00:06 +0000", "image_url": "https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/5b1da210-ddf8-11ed-97df-34fa25f770cb"}, {"title": "Instant's Vortex Mini air fryer is on sale for $40", "description": "If you've been eyeing a new air fryer but don't want something too large or pricey, Instant's Vortex Mini is the top budget pick in our air fryer buying guide, and it's currently down to $40 as part of a new sale. While this isn't the lowest price we've seen, it's within $5, and it represents a roughly $10 drop from the 2-quart air fryer's typical street price. Just note the deal only applies to the aqua blue model.As a refresher, an air fryer works like a smaller, pod-shaped convection oven. It can cook smaller foods better than a microwave, and it's typically faster and more energy-efficient than a traditional oven. The Vortex Mini is among the most compact models we've tested, so it can't cook a ton of food at once, but we've found it to perform well for single servings and side dishes like french fries, tofu, pizza slices or roasted veggies. It has four preprogrammed buttons \\xe2\\x80\\x94 air fry, bake, roast and reheat \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and we generally found it simple to operate. Because it's only about a foot tall and nine inches wide, it doesn't take up much countertop space, nor is it a hassle to clean. All of this makes the Vortex Mini a decent accessory for those living in smaller spaces who mainly cook for themselves.This deal comes as part of a couple of wider sales on Instant kitchen accessories at Amazon. If you're looking for a larger air fryer, the top pick in our guide, the six-quart Instant Vortex Plus, is on sale for $130, which is about $20 less than usual.

It was a daily part of life for five years when I lived off-grid. Granted, we were composting more than just food, but I got to know carbon/nitrogen ratios, ideal moisture levels, proper aeration and everything else that distinguishes a healthy compost pile from an unpleasant mass of rot. Now as a city dweller, I still believe in composting and continue to do it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but no longer in my backyard.Each person in the US throws away about 200 pounds of food per year on average. Once it hits a landfill, food waste does bad stuff, like releasing methane and contributing to climate change, instead of good stuff, like improving the soil and acting as a carbon sink. Composting solves those problems, and many cities are starting to realize it helps them with waste management, too. Nine of the 20 largest metro areas in the US now have some form of residentialcompostservice, or will in the next year or so. But if you live elsewhere and want to stop putting your food scraps in the trash, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to you. You have three main options: compost in your backyard, buy a machine or pay someone to do it for you.How to compost at homeIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tempting to think of composting as building a holder, throwing in food and coming back a few weeks later to something you can toss in your garden, but the reality requires much more time, space and effort. For me, the toughest part of composting was the consistency it required. At least a few times per week, any active compost pile needs tending, including adding to it, turning it, watering it in dry climates or shielding it from excess rain. In addition to time, home composting requires the space and materials to build the bins. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also need a regular source of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or carbon-rich materials like dried leaves, untreated paper, cardboard, sawdust or wood chips.Plenty of people (with more knowledge than I) have put together how-tos on the subject. I followed The Mini Farming Guide to Composting, but these online guides will also serve you well:EPA: Offers a high-level overview of the process and includes a handy chart with examples of green and brown materials.ILSR: A more in-depth guide, complete with illustrations and the reasoning behind each step.NMSU: A science-rich reference with multiple methods and troubleshooting suggestions.Joe Gardener: A multi-page, highly detailed PDF from Joe Lamp\\xe2\\x80\\x99l, the host of PBS and DIY Network gardening shows.Each source gives the same basic advice: build your bin, collect your food scraps, stockpile brown materials, maintain your ratios, monitor and amend moisture and aeration levels, then let a full heap finish for six to eight weeks (so yes, you generally need two piles).As you can see, composting correctly isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as easy as chucking scraps into a bin and letting time handle the rest. Of course, if the process appeals to you (and it is pretty fascinating) that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a drawback. Gardeners in particular, who are out in the yard anyway, make excellent candidates for keeping up healthy piles \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not to mention, they also have the most use for the finished product. People without yards, however, are out of luck (unless they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re comfortable hosting an indoor worm farm).Photo by Amy Skorheim / EngadgetKitchen composting machinesCalling them \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomposters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a misnomer, since these devices don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually create compost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that requires microbial processes that take weeks. Instead, these appliances chop and dehydrate food, creating an odor-free material that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s substantially smaller in volume than what went in. You can even include meat and dairy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an advantage over home compost piles in which animal products are generally not recommended. As for what comes out, it can be added to your backyard pile, spread in your garden, added to houseplants or thrown in the green bin or trash \\xe2\\x80\\x93 where it will take up less room and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stink anything up.I haven't tested any of these devices, but after researching from the perspective of a fairly informed composter, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I see as the pros and cons of a few of the more popular devices on the market.Mill ($33 - $45 per month)I like that Mill offers a solution for the substance it produces and that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s large enough to hold the scraps an average family might generate over the course of a few weeks. Instead of buying the machine outright, you sign up for a subscription, which includes the Mill bin and USPS pickup for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrounds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it creates. Add food throughout the day and the dehydration and mixing cycles run automatically each night. Once it's full, you empty the contents into a prepaid box and ship it to Mill who will then turn the grounds into food for chickens.Mill is now shipping, and according to Mill, the company is \"still working through the scientific and regulatory processes to sell the chicken feed commercially.\" The service costs $45 per month, unless you pay annually, then it works out to $33 monthly.Lomi ($369 - $749)Lomi also chops and dehydrates your scraps. The unit is smaller than the Mill, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll likely have to empty it every few days. It offers three modes, one of which, Grow Mode, uses small capsules of probiotics called Lomi Pods to create \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplant food\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in about 20 hours. Lomi suggests mixing the results with regular soil at a ratio of one to ten.If you have a yard, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy enough to add a little here and there to maintain the ratio, and if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re an apartment dweller with houseplants you can mix small amounts into the soil. But the end product should only be used sparingly, like a fertilizer, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably need to do something else with the excess. Lomi suggests giving the excess away or dropping it into your green bin if your city provides curbside compost pickup.Vitamix FoodCycler ($400)All of these devices are basically blenders with a heating element, so it makes sense that Vitamix has a unit on the market. The FoodCycler is smaller than the Lomi, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably best for households with one or two people. The results can be mixed sparingly into plants, added to your green bins or thrown out. Whichever way, the processed scraps will stink less, take up less space and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t add more methane rot to a landfill.Reencle ($499)Reencle is larger like the Mill bin, and involves microorganisms in the process like Lomi. You can buy it outright or rent it for $30 per month, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t include pickup for the results. I like that Reencle is, in essence, a living pile of fermentation, using low heat, grinders and a regenerating bacterial population to break down your food scraps.Adding scraps daily \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeeds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the pile, and when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only supposed to remove about half of what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in there, leaving the rest to breed more Bacilli. Again, the material works as a plant food or fertilizer, not like standard compost. Reencle recommends a byproduct-to-soil ratio of one part to four, and that you let the mixture sit for five days before adding to your monsteras and gardens.Photo by Amy Skorheim / EngadgetWhy you should consider a composting serviceDIY home composting is a lot of work. Countertop machines are expensive and, from what users say, noisy and often unreliable. Both methods leave you to figure out what to do with the byproduct, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the finished compost from your bins or the dehydrated proto-compost from the appliances.If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a gardener, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re golden \\xe2\\x80\\x93 compost makes plants happy. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried farming and now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather ride my bike to the burrito stand than grow my own food. Since I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live in a city that offers municipal curbside organics pickup, I pay for a local service and I recommend it.Most subscription-based compost pick-up services work the same way: for a monthly fee, they provide you with a bucket and lid. You fill the bucket with leftovers and set it on your front porch/steps/stoop on pickup day. They collect your bucket, leaving you a fresh one on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis. Scraps are then composted on a large scale and the results are sold to local farms or people in the community.Each service has different rules about what you can add, but most let you throw all food and food-related items in the bucket (including meat, bones, dairy and fruit pits). You can also usually include coffee filters, pizza boxes, houseplants, BPI-certified compostable plastics and paper towels (without cleaning products on them). All services ask that you remove produce stickers and pull the staples from your teabags.I have our pickup scheduled for every other Tuesday. Does two weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of food in a bucket stink? It does. To help with that, we keep our bucket outside with the lid firmly on. I keep a canister on the countertop to fill with scraps throughout the day and empty it into the bucket when the canister is full or starts to smell. I also keep old food in the fridge until right before collection day.Of course, these services aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t available everywhere, and they cost $20 to $40 per month, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a universal solution. I pay $22 for a twice monthly pickup and I look at the cost in terms of time: I would spend more than two hours a month maintaining a compost pile, so if I value my labor at $12 per hour, which is my state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minimum wage, the cost is worth it.I like the little perks too, like getting a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bag of compost twice per year and having a place to drop off our yearly batch of jack-o-lanterns once the faces start caving in. I also know that some of what I put in eventually goes to the lavender farm up the road from me. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a much better end game for my avocado pit than being sealed up for eternity in a landfill.A sampling of composting services in the largest US marketsModern tech is making it easier for these services to pop up in more cities. Sign-up is done online and most payments are automatic. My driver told me they use the Stop Suite app to optimize their pickup routes, send out text reminders and handle other customer service functions. Composting may be old as dirt, but the way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re creating it is brand new.Of the 20 largest metro areas in the US, nine have or will have municipally-run compost collection programs. Each of the other eleven areas have at least one community composting service available.

The new Xiaomi 13 Ultra packs not three but four rear Leica cameras, with the 23mm OIS (optical image stabilization) main camera using the same \"1-inch\" 50-megapixel Sony IMX989 sensor, but now with variable aperture to toggle between f/1.9 and f/4.0 for different artistic takes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have some sample shots in the gallery further down.\\xa0The remaining three cameras do ultra-wide (12mm, f/1.8, 122-degree FOV), periscopic 5x zoom (120mm, f/3.0, OIS) and the new 3.2x zoom (75mm, f/1.8, OIS) for sharp portraits with more bokeh. These all use the new 50-megapixel 1/2.51-inch IMX858 sensor, which claims to offer the same noise reduction, all-pixel focus and DOL-HDR performance as its 1-inch cousin. If true, this would ensure a more consistent image quality across all four cameras, which had been a big challenge for smartphone makers previously. On the other side of the phone, the punch-hole selfie camera remains at 32 megapixels.The variable aperture on the Xiaomi 13 Ultra's main camera, with the left one set at the default f/1.9, and the right one at f/4.0.Image by Richard Lai for Engadget.As with recent flagship phones, it comes as no surprise that the Xiaomi 13 Ultra is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. The device also supports USB 3.2 with up to 5Gbps of transfer speed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 10x faster than the 12S Ultra \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and up to 4K 60Hz of DisplayPort video output. The slightly larger 5,000mAh battery is complemented by a 90W charger, which reaches 100-percent charge in 35 minutes. You can also use it with Xiaomi's 50W wireless charger, when you're not in a rush. But if you do run out of juice, the new \"Hibernation mode\" can apparently stretch the final 1-percent battery into 60-minute standby or a 12-minute call, thanks to Xiaomi's very own P2 and G1 co-processors.While the AMOLED display still comes in at 6.73 inches wide with the same 3,200 x 1,440 resolution, this time it's a new LTPO panel supplied by CSOT (a TCL subsidiary). This supposedly benefits from a new C7 luminous material with a more precise 12-bit color depth, along with a peak brightness of 2,600 nits (or up to 1,300 nits in high brightness mode), better viewing angles and lower power consumption. You get Dolby Vision support as well.XiaomiAs with its predecessor, the Xiaomi 13 Ultra features IP68 rating for dust- and water-resistance. In addition to its metallic unibody, the device also consists of a second-generation nano-tech material with anti-bacterial properties and UV resistance. Internally, it touts a new loop-shaped vapor cooling chamber, which uses multiple liquid channels to supposedly dissipate heat three times faster than a conventional design. This is mainly to keep the phone cool while shooting 4K videos.\\xa0The company also implemented a dual-wing cellular antenna module, which apparently offers a 58-percent boost in signal reception across all bands. As a bonus, the symmetrical antenna layout should reduce interference from hands, and there's also a new dedicated 5G antenna which apparently boosts the n78 band's signal by 100 percent.XiaomiThe Xiaomi 13 Ultra is already available for pre-order in China, starting from 5,999 yuan (around $870) for the 12GB RAM with 256GB storage model, all the way to 7,299 yuan (around $1,060) for the 16GB RAM with 1TB storage option. Color-wise, you can choose between olive green, black and white. For an extra 799 yuan ($120), you can get the \"Xiaomi 13 Ultra Professional Photography Kit\" which includes a camera grip attachment (with a physical shutter button) and a special phone case \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one that lets you attach the included 67mm filter ring adapter and lens cap.Engadget understands that the Xiaomi 13 Ultra will reach international markets at some point (except for the white version, sadly), so stay tuned.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/xiaomis-13-ultra-features-four-leica-tuned-cameras-132616095.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/xiaomis-13-ultra-features-four-leica-tuned-cameras-132616095.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 13:26:16 +0000", "image_url": "https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b4292e50-de49-11ed-b7e3-652c02d8e016"}, {"title": "Samsung's News app brings daily headlines and podcasts to Galaxy devices", "description": "Samsung is replacing its Free app on Galaxy devices with a client that's more focused, if also a little familiar.

Samsung is shifting its attention to services at a time when the phone market is grim \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you may be more likely to stick to your Galaxy phone (and pay for content on it) if services like News prove appealing.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-news-app-brings-daily-headlines-and-podcasts-to-galaxy-devices-130108893.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-news-app-brings-daily-headlines-and-podcasts-to-galaxy-devices-130108893.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 13:01:08 +0000", "image_url": null}, {"title": "The best E ink tablets for 2023", "description": "I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a notebook person for most of my life. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had dozens of notebooks over the years that served as repositories for to-do lists, story ideas, messages jotted down during meetings and everything in between. But at a certain point in my adult life, I turned away from physical notebooks because it became easier to save all of those things digitally in various apps that were always available to me on my phone. I sacrificed tactile satisfaction for digital convenience, and a small part of me mourns for all of the half-filled notebooks I left in my wake.For some like me, an E ink tablet may be the solution to those dueling impulses. They can combine the feeling of writing in a regular notebook with many of the conveniences of digitized documents. E ink tablets allow you to take all of your notes with you on one device, while also letting you scribble with a stylus just like you would with pen-and-paper. Unlike regular tablets and styli, though, E ink tablets are nowhere near ubiquitous \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but there are just enough players in the game to make deciding which one to buy more complicated than you might think. We tested out a bunch of the most popular E ink tablets available now to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best available today.Are E ink tablets worth it?An E ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an E ink display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.The final note is key here. Most E ink tablets don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the same functionality as regular tablets, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of color and lower quality than the panels you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find on even the cheapest iPad.Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. An e-reader is also worth considering if this is the case for you, but just know that most standard e-readers do not accept stylus input. If you like to make notes in the margins of books, underline and mark up PDFs and the like, an e-reader won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cut it.What to look for in an E ink tabletI discovered four main things that can really make or break your experience with an E ink tablet during my testing; first is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpaper,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so to speak?) and the stylus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 latency. Most had little to no latency, but there were some that were worse than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E ink tablet comes with a stylus. Believe it or not, many of them require you to purchase the pen separately.The second thing to consider is the reading experience. How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? While you can find E ink tablets in all different sizes, most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).The supported file types will also make a big difference. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E ink tablet. And with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet supports reading apps like Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Kindle or the Kobo app, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.Third, most E ink tablets have some search features, but they can vary widely between models. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed that Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Kobo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s E ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save on which pages you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.The final factor to consider is sharing and connectivity. Yes, we established that E ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, but most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t created in a vacuum. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll likely want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E ink tablets I tried were WiFi devices, and some supported cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll interact with on your E ink tablet after the tablet portion is done.Best for most: reMarkable 2The latest reMarkable tablet isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t topping our list because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most full-featured or even most interesting E ink tablet we tested. Rather, it provides the best mix of features people will find useful in a device like this. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get into them all, but first, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth mentioning build quality. The reMarkable 2 weighs less than one pound and is one of the sleekest E ink tablets we tried. It has a 10.3-inch monochrome digital paper display that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surrounded by beige-colored bezels, with the chunkiest portion at the bottom edge where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d naturally grip it. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a slim silver bezel on the left side, which attaches to accessories like the folio case and the new Type Folio keyboard. Hats off to reMarkable for making an E ink tablet that feels right at home with all of your other fancy gadgets.Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start with the writing and reading experiences on the reMarkable 2, both of which are great. From the get go, scribbling, doodling and writing was a breeze. We tested out the Marker Plus, which has a built-in eraser, but both it and the standard Marker are tilt- and pressure sensitive pens, and require no batteries or charging. I observed basically no lag between my pressing down onto the reMarkable 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s screen and lines showing up. The latency was so low that it felt the closest to actual pen-and-paper. But I will say that this is not unique among our top picks in this guide \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost all of the E ink tablets we tested got this very crucial feature right.When it comes to reading, the reMarkable 2 supports PDFs and ePUBs, and you can add files to the device by logging into your reMarkable account on desktop or via the companion mobile app on your phone. You can also pair your Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox account with your reMarkable account and access files that way as well. That should be good enough for anyone who, say, reads a lot of academic papers or reviews many documents for work. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be harder for people who purchase their ebooks from online marketplaces like the Kindle or Kobo stores, but there are other options for those.Another fun way to get documents onto the reMarkable 2 is via the Read with reMarkable extension for Google Chrome. After installing it and pairing your reMarkable account, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to send articles you find online directly to your reMarkable 2 so you can check them out later. You can even customize these files to be sent as text only, which will let you change their format directly on your reMarkable, or as a PDF. Regardless of which you choose, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to mark up these articles as you would any other file on the E ink tablet. I used this extension a lot and I did enjoy reading longform articles on the reMarkable 2 more than on my iPhone. Being able to underline, highlight and otherwise mark up those stories was more of a bonus than a necessity for me, but for others who glean sources from online materials will be better off for it.Overall, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty easy to get files onto the reMarkable 2 and it is possible to access themelsewhere when you may not be able to whip out the E ink tablet. Those with a reMarkable Connect subscription will have the best experience, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice perk that you get a one-year membership when you buy one. The $3-per-month subscription provides the ability to edit existing notes and take new ones from anywhere using the desktop and mobile apps, plus unlimited cloud storage and syncing. On that last front, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay for Connect, only \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnotes and documents synced online in the last 50 days\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be available in reMarkable\\xe2\\x80\\x99s companion apps. I suspect 50 days worth of document syncing will be enough for some, but not power-users. Putting the ability to take notes anywhere behind a paywall is a bit of a bummer no matter what and makes it much harder for anyone to use the reMarkable ecosystem as their main note-taking space.That said, I kept most of my testing to the reMarkable 2 itself and was impressed by its ability to be a digital notebook without a steep learning curve. You can create different notebooks and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquick sheets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to organize your handwritten notes, and folders to make sense of imported files. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find eight different brush types with which to mark up documents and take notes, along with various line thicknesses and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccolors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (which just show up as shades on the tablet itself). You can even type wherever you want in a doc, and the reMarkable 2 can translate handwritten notes into machine-readable text with surprising accuracy.It was no shock that the reMarkable 2 ended up having the best mix of features, along with a relatively low learning curve. The company was one of the first on the scene with a truly viable E ink tablet back in 2017, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been refining the experience ever since. But that comes at a cost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the reMarkable 2 isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the most expensive E ink tablet we tested, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not cheap either. The tablet alone will set you back $299, and then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to shell out either $79 or $129 for the Marker or Marker Plus, respectively. In all, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at $430 for the best version of the reMarkable 2 you can get (and that assumes you skip the new $199 Type Folio Keyboard). You could get a 9th-gen iPad and the 1st-gen Apple Pencil for the same price and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a more flexible duo, purely based on the capabilities of iOS.But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably not considering an iPad for a specific reason, whether that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your love for E ink or the feeling of pen-to-paper writing, or you simply want a more distraction-free experience. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for an E ink tablet that will not take ages to get used to, offers a stellar writing experience and makes it relatively simple to access notes elsewhere, the reMarkable 2 is your best bet.Best e-reader E ink tablet: Amazon Kindle ScribeYou really have two options in this space: the Amazon Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Elipsa 2E. The Scribe edged out the Elipsa 2E purely because of its low-latency pen-and-screen combination. The Elipsa has its merits, which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get into in a bit, but it just couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t compete with the Scribe when it came to a seamless and smooth handwriting experience.We already gave the Kindle Scribe the full review treatment, and in general, I enjoyed it while testing it out for this guide, too. As mentioned, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little to no latency when writing on the Scribe with its companion pen. Thanks to the latest software update, you also have more brush types to choose from now, including fountain pen, marker and pencil, which add to the charm. Like other E ink tablets, the Scribe makes it easy to create multiple notebooks, and you can add pages to them and change up their templates if you wish.As an e-reader, the Scribe shines not only thanks to its 10.2-inch display with auto-adjusting front lights, but also because you have Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entire ebook store at your fingertips. If you get most of your reading material from Amazon or subscribe to Kindle Unlimited, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to jump right into all of your titles instantly on the Scribe. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also easy to get ebooks from your local library and read them on a Kindle. This will be crucial not only for voracious readers, but especially for students who buy or rent digital textbooks and those who consume books regularly for research purposes.I thought about students a lot when using the Scribe. I started college in 2009, two years after the first Kindle was released and one year before the first iPad came out. Getting textbooks digitally really wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an option for me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I can understand the appeal a device like the Kindle Scribe would have for students. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arguably even better than a standard Kindle because its screen is bigger, which will make it less tiring to stare at for long periods of time. Adding the ability to take handwritten notes while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re studying is icing on the cake.However, Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s execution of book notes is not my favorite. You actually cannot take notes in the margins of Kindle ebooks. Instead you press and hold the pen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tip on the screen to highlight text or add a note to a particular word or phrase. If you do the latter, a window pops up on the bottom half of the screen where you can either take a handwritten note or type a text note using the Scribe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mildly frustrating and sluggish on-screen keyboard.This is where I give a nod to the Kobo Elipsa 2E, where you can write notes in the margins, underline, circle and otherwise mark up your reading material. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a more natural (and fun) experience since it mimics what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do if you were reading a physical book. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shame that the latency on the Elipsa was just a hair more noticeable than that of the Scribe. If it weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for that, it might have beaten Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s device here.What that extra bit of latency translates to in practice is handwriting that can come out just a bit messier, and that increases precipitously the faster you write. But that also means that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll notice this the most when taking notes longhand on the Elipsa; if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re primarily using an E ink tablet to mark up documents, it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affect you as much. Despite that, I did like the way Kobo executed notebooks on the Elipsa. You can have a standard notebook where you can write and scribble away, or an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadvanced\\xe2\\x80\\x9d notebook that supports handwriting-to-text conversion and inserting things like diagrams and formulas. Text conversion is actually pretty accurate, too, even when dealing with some of my ugliest handwriting.Kobo also has a pretty sizable ebook marketplace, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly a decent option if you want to stay clear of the Amazon ecosystem. But Amazon has the upper hand when it comes to price. The Kobo Elipsa 2E pack that includes its stylus is $399, while the 16GB Kindle Scribe with the premium pen (which includes dedicated eraser and shortcut buttons) comes in at $369. Even if you max out the Scribe with 64GB of storage, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d only spend $20 more than you would on the Kobo Elipsa. That, combined with the Scribe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strong overall performance and the ubiquity of Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ebook offerings will make it the better choice for most readers.Best as a notebook: Supernote XI spent a while testing all of these E ink tablets, and the Supernote X is the one I was consistently most excited to use. As a notebook nerd, I find this thing so cool. Available in 10.3-inch (what I tested) and 7.8-inch sizes, the Supernote X has a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFeelWrite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d screen protector that has a different feel than a standard E ink screen. When writing on it with Heart of Metal Pen 2, which is weighty and looks like a fountain pen, you get a gel pen-like feel rather than the subtly scratchy vibe that other E ink tablets have. In fact, the Supernote X has one of the best writing experiences out of any tablet I tested.The Supernote X supports a range of file types, including PDF, ePUB, Word (.doc), PNG and JPG, which really opens up the content you can put onto the thing. I wanted to see if I could treat it almost like a digital bullet journal, and that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hard to do. There are built-in page templates, but I was able to download daily, weekly and monthly planner templates online, resize them and move them onto the Supernote X using Android File Transfer. The device has a dedicated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMyStyle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d folder where you can save files you want to use as templates. The most difficult part was making sure I had the dimensions right while resizing the documents. Once saved in the right folder, I could make an entire notebook out of the templates I had gotten from the internet for free.Supernote does have its own \\xe2\\x80\\x9capp store,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not much in there, and its Play Store offerings are limited to only the Kindle app. This device doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a backlight, so it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be easy to see in dark environments. But you can download Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ebook app and read just like you would on a standard tablet (no, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mark up books here either).Honestly, the last thing I wanted to do with the Supernote X was read, though. The device really shines as an E ink notebook and the company clearly put a lot of thought into \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuilding a better mousetrap,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so to speak. You can translate handwritten words into typed text, but you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do that in order for the software to recognize your handwriting. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a keywords feature that lets you basically bookmark important phrases for quick access later. All you need to do is lasso the word, press the keyword button and the tablet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s software will translate your writing into typed text. Then you can add it as a keyword and quickly jump back to it from the left-side tablet of contents menu. Similarly, you can bookmark titles and add stars to pages that are important, all of which help you jump between important bits.That said, the Supernote X sometimes felt a little inconsistent. The writing experience was top-notch, but there were other things that felt a little less polished. For example, you can swipe down on the right bezel to bring up a menu that lets you quickly navigate between favorited notes and recent documents \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite thoughtful. But then the Files page just has a couple of starkly named folders like Export, Screenshot and Inbox that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch once, and the pen sidebar has more options than most people will know what to do with (and none of them have text labels).These are small nit-picks, but they go to show that the Supernote X might not be the best device for tech novices. There is a learning curve here, but notebook nerds like myself will be thrilled with all that the Supernote X has to offer. Unsurprisingly, all those advanced features come at a steep price: the A5-sized tablet with a folio and pen will set you back at least $532, making it the most expensive set on our list.Honorable mention: Boox Note Air 2 PlusIf you removed some of the notebook-specific features from the Supernote X and added in a more complete version of Android 11, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get the Boox Note Air 2 Plus. Boox makes a number of interesting E ink tablets and the Note Air 2 Plus is the one that best compares to the others on our list thanks to its 10.3-inch display. This is an Android tablet with an E ink screen, so that means you can actually download Android apps like Kindle, Kobo and others. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even a web browser, and yes, you can watch videos on this thing, too.Of course, just because you can do all of that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you should. E ink screens are truly best for reading and writing, so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend much time binge watching YouTube on the Note Air 2 Plus \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I was happy that I had the freedom to do so. Really, the utility of Android comes in with the app store and I expect that most people will use it to download all of their favorite reading and writing apps. Much like a standard tablet, the Note Air 2 Plus will be a great option for anyone that gets their reading material from a bunch of different places \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and since you can manually transfer documents from your computer to the device, too, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s far-and-away the most versatile option on our list.I experienced little to no latency when writing on the Note Air 2 Plus and I was happy with the number of brush options it has. Like the Supernote X, it comes with a bunch of page templates you can use, or you can bring in your own PDFs and other documents to use as templates. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAI recognition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature that translates a whole page\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handwriting into typed text, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually pretty accurate. (Though, it did consistently confuse my \\xe2\\x80\\x9c&\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for a capital A). I also appreciated that you can add other kinds of material to your notes, including web pages and voice recordings, and share notes as PDFs or PNGs via email, Google Drive and other services. Features like those ensure that, with this partially analog device, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t miss out on some of the conveniences that a true digital notebook system would have.Instead of going into all of the features the Note Air 2 Plus offers, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most useful to talk about the value of this device. A bundle with the tablet, a standard pen and a folio case comes in at $500, putting it on the higher end of the price spectrum among the devices we tested. But considering it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a full Android tablet, that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem absurd. Those who want to avoid distractions most of the time while still having access to email and a web browser might gravitate towards a device like this. Also, most of Boox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s devices operate in the same way, so you do have more affordable options if you like this blueprint. For example, the Boox Nova Air 2 is a 7.8-inch version of the Note Air 2 Plus, with slightly different RAM and storage specs to match, and its bundle comes in at $370.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 13:00:37 +0000", "image_url": null}]}, {"title": "NYT > Technology", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology", "items": [{"title": "Reddit Wants to Get Paid for Helping to Teach Big A.I.
