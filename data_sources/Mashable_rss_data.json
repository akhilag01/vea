But if you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.Where did Wordle come from?Originally created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, Wordle rapidly spread to become an international phenomenon, with thousands of people around the globe playing every day. Alternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\\xa0Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.Not the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for April 18.What's the best Wordle starting word?The best Wordle starting word is the one that brings joy to your heart. But if what brings you joy is strategy, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.Is Wordle getting harder?It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:A big hit.Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?Not today!Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...Today's Wordle starts with the letter T.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Wordle-obsessed?

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a twice-occurring letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?No.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?P, O, L, and C.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

The move was called out on Tuesday by LGBTQ advocacy organization Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            YouTube updates guidelines for eating disorder-related content\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe provision was first added in 2018, stating, in part, \"We prohibit targeting others with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.\" As of April 8, the policy no longer includes the second sentence, GLAAD found via the Wayback Machine. In a statement issued Tuesday, GLAAD called the move \"the latest example of just how unsafe the company is for users and advertisers alike.\"\"The practice of targeted misgendering and deadnaming has been identified by the ADL and other civil society groups as a form of hate speech. Social media companies committed to maintaining safe environments for LGBTQ people should be working to improve hate speech policies, not deleting long-standing ones,\" wrote GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis.Media outlets and Twitter insiders have previously reported on Twitter CEO Elon Musk's intention to review the provisions of the hateful conduct policy specifically related to trans users. Shortly after he took over the site, Bloomberg reported that Musk had already asked employees \"to review Twitter\\u2019s hateful conduct policy, according to the people, specifically a section that says users can be penalized for 'targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.'\" This came shortly before the billionaire disbanded the site's Trust and Safety Council. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nTwitter's adjusted many of its user conduct policies over the last six months, in moves often described as being aligned with Musk's \"free speech\" goals. This week, the platform announced it would no longer remove all tweets in violation of its hateful conduct policy, but instead add \"warning labels\" to the posts. Tweets with this label reportedly will have \"limited visibility\" to other users.Last year, TikTok banned anti-trans conduct on its app, including deadnaming and misgendering. Meta platforms, like Instagram and Facebook, provide policies for gender- and sexuality-based harassment, and the company was reconsidering its moderation policies last year. None of the sites are doing enough to protect LGBTQ users, however, according to a 2022 study by GLAAD. GLAAD's recent statement also referenced the #StopToxicTwitter coalition, a network of more than 60 civil rights and civil society groups that have been pushing for the social media platform to ensure the safety of its users through pressure on its top advertisers. The organization noted that Musk's history of anti-LGBTQ posting was particularly concerning, linking to recent tweets from Musk that implied doctors providing gender affirming care should go to prison. In February, nonprofit research organization The Center for Countering Digital Hate issued a report that found the app was making up for its advertising losses by reinstating previously-banned, \"problematic\" tweeters that would guarantee greater user impressions through their posts. The findings added to an already documented rise in hate speech on the site, which has prompted some users to leave the site and organizations to advocate for support.Advocacy groups plan to continue placing pressure on advertisers and industry leaders at this week's POSSIBLE conference, a global marketing event billing Musk as a keynote speaker, GLAAD noted.\"This decision to roll back LGBTQ safety pulls Twitter even more out of step with TikTok, Pinterest, and Meta,\" said Ellis, \"which all maintain similar policies to protect their transgender users at a time when anti-transgender rhetoric online is leading to real world discrimination and violence.\"", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/glaad-twitter-lgbtq-hate-speech-policy", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 22:50:56 +0000"}, {"title": "After 25 years, Netflix will finally stop shipping DVDs to people", "description": "Hello, youth.

The move came as Twitter prepares to transition its currently free API service to a paid subscription model starting at an exorbitant $42,000 per month for Enterprise access.Twitter users were immediately outraged by the decision. Many advocated for the company to make exemptions for important public service accounts, like the NWS, which provides vital alerts during extreme weather events. Then, suddenly, a few verified \"breaking news\" Twitter accounts shared an update: Twitter had reversed course. Elon Musk and company was going to make that exception for NWS accounts and allow them access to the API without limits. Media outlets like CNN quickly covered Twitter's apparent change of heart. Twitter users were jubilant over the news.Only, it's not true. Mashable reached out to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce which runs the National Weather Service, to confirm the unofficial reports that have spread on the platform.\"Twitter informed NWS there are no plans for exemptions,\" National Weather Service Director of Public Affairs Susan Buchanan told Mashable in a statement.\\xa0Mashable connected with the NWS once more to confirm again and Buchanann reiterated in a separate email that the statement is accurate. As of now, Twitter has said it will not provide API exceptions for the NWS and has not provided the agency with any further official communication on the matter.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nAs proof of the change, some Twitter users shared a tweet from the NWS's Tsunami Alerts account, which announced on early Sunday morning that its API access was restored. But according to the NWS, Twitter only restored temporary API access via the company's old API plans, which Twitter is planning to sunset in a few weeks. Also, the restoration only affected some NWS accounts, with others still currently unable to post automated weather alerts. As of publication, the NWS said that it still expects the Tsunami Alerts system, along with any other NWS accounts with API access, to lose that access in a few weeks when Twitter says it will fully switch to its new API plans. \"While some of these accounts were reinstated over the weekend, some remained suspended this morning,\" the NWS said. \"None of those accounts had exceeded Twitter's new API limit.\"The spread of unconfirmed reportsIt appears that the report that Twitter was making an exemption for NWS accounts originated with a Twitter account that goes by the name \"T(w)itter Daily News.\"\\xa0\"NEWS: Twitter will allow the National Weather Service accounts to continue Tweeting weather alerts without limits,\" the account tweeted on Saturday night. \"Great Job @TwitterDev.\"\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nOther media outlets and \"breaking news\" Twitter accounts seem to have then run with that tweet as the official update. In CNN's report, the media organization even attributed that tweet directly to Twitter.However, that account is not an official Twitter account. The account handle is actually @TitterDaily \\u2013 Twitter without the \"W.\" The reason for that is because Twitter does not allow users to create usernames with the word \"Twitter\" in it. Usernames that include the word \"Twitter\" are solely reserved for official company accounts.The @TitterDaily account is verified with a blue checkmark. But, that's because the account pays for Twitter Blue, the Musk-created Twitter service that allows any user to pay $8 per month in order to receive a verification badge.In reality, @TitterDaily is just a fan-run account created by a longtime supporter of Musk and Tesla. Musk did recently follow the account and subscribe to it via the platform's Subscription service. Mashable reached out to Twitter to find out if there was any truth to these reported exemptions, perhaps communicated to @TitterDaily from someone at the company. However, Twitter no longer responds to requests from the press. In addition, as told to Mashable multiple times, Twitter explicitly said to NWS that there would be no exemptions and there has been no communication that NWS has received since that says otherwise as of Tuesday, April 18. How Twitter's new API rules will affect public safety accountsThe NWS tells Mashable that Twitter's API policy changes will limit its accounts to 50 automated tweets per 24-hour period. It expects that Twitter will officially switch its accounts to the new API limits on April 29, based on what the company has previously communicated to developers.\"Since 2014, NWS has used Twitter\\u2019s API service to auto-post the latest warnings for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods to Twitter feeds that are followed by emergency managers, the media, and people in the path of dangerous weather,\" the NWS said in its statement.\\xa0With Twitter's new limits, the NWS will be unable to tell which automated emergency alerts go through and which don't get posted. This will make the NWS Twitter accounts unreliable during weather emergencies.\"For every warning issued, seconds could make the difference between life and death,\" the statement reads, explaining how the automated emergency alert posts have an advantage over the forecasters who also tweet from the accounts.And it isn't just NWS accounts that have been affected.\\xa0Twitter's API changes threaten various public transportation accounts from being able to share up-to-the-minute information on the platform. At @TitterDaily's urging, earthquake tracking accounts like @LastQuake and weather services like Instant Weather in Canada have spent the past few days asking followers to plead with Twitter and Musk to provide these seemingly non-existent API exemptions to their accounts as well.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nAs for the National Weather Service, the agency seems prepared to do its best under Twitter's new free API limits. Twitter does provide a $100 per month per account API plan, but the company itself describes this subscription tier as being for \"hobbyists\" or \"students.\" After that, the next paid API option from Twitter is the $42,000 per month Enterprise plan. As of now, it does not appear that the National Weather Service is prepared to pay for such access.The NWS tells Mashable that Twitter's users should not depend on NWS Twitter accounts for the \"most current information for forecasts, watches, and warnings.\"\\xa0\"We advise people to have multiple ways to receive weather forecasts including weather.gov,\" the NWS said.The full statement provided to Mashable from the National Weather Service can be read below:Twitter announced a policy change to its Application Programming Interface (API) service that will limit the number of automated tweets to 50 per 24-hour period. When implemented, this change would affect National Weather Service Twitter accounts that auto-tweet more than the new limit. Since 2014, NWS has used Twitter\\u2019s API service to auto-post the latest warnings for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods to Twitter feeds that are followed by emergency managers, the media, and people in the path of dangerous weather.Without this automated process, it would take minutes for forecasters to manually prepare warning information into a tweet. For every warning issued, seconds could make the difference between life and death. Communications via social media is a supplemental service to extend the reach of weather forecasts and information. Twitter feeds do not always reflect the most current information for forecasts, watches, and warnings, and we advise people to have multiple ways to receive weather forecasts including weather.gov. Twitter informed NWS there are no plans for exemptions.From media reports, we anticipate the new API limits to become effective on April 29, 2023. However, a new issue emerged when several of our API accounts were suspended on Friday, April 14. While some of these accounts were reinstated over the weekend, some remained suspended this morning. None of those accounts had exceeded Twitter's new API limit. Those, and all other NWS accounts, can still manually issue tweets but will face the challenge of timing and staff capacity that the automated tweets do not face.\\xa0\\xa0", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/twitter-exemptions-nws-public-service-safety-weather-accounts", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:11:32 +0000"}, {"title": "YouTube updates guidelines for eating disorder-related content", "description": "YouTube announced Tuesday that it's updating the video platform's approach to eating disorder content.YouTube, which is owned by Google, said in a statement that its community guidelines will now prohibit material that features imitable behavior. The move is designed to limit viewers' exposure to videos that show or describe certain disordered eating behaviors, like severe calorie restriction or purging. YouTube worked with experts at the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) and other organizations to identify behaviors most likely to influence at-risk viewers. The new policies expand on existing guidelines that remove content that glorifies or promotes eating disorders.  The updated guidelines also implement age restrictions for content that discusses disordered eating in the context of recovery. While this content may appear in an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic format, it will not be viewable for those under 18, or to users who are signed out. Additionally, such videos embedded on another website will not play. YouTube said it sought to \"strike the right balance\" between protecting younger viewers from behaviors they may try to imitate and making it possible for creators to document their experiences with eating disorder recovery.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'You're always on': Warnings from the front lines of the teen mental health crisis\\n            \\n\\n\\n\"YouTube is an important platform for raising awareness and understanding of mental health issues like eating disorders, and we want to continue empowering creators to share their stories,\" Dr. Garth Graham, director of health partnerships at YouTube, said in a statement. \"We believe this approach, informed by third-party experts, creates space for community and recovery while protecting viewers.\" While crisis resource panels, which contain referral information for people seeking help or treatment, currently appear in search results, YouTube's new approach will now include placing the same information under videos related to eating disorders in several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, and France.

In collaboration with YouTube, the nonprofit organization recently launched a year-long series on its own YouTube channel that focuses on eating disorder information and lived experience. The earlier a person with an eating disorder seeks and receives treatment, the likelihood that they'll have a physical and emotional recovery increases, according to NEDA.\"Video content is a compelling way to reach people online, and so we\\u2019re heartened by the further concrete actions being taken by YouTube to mitigate harm and help counteract content that can lead to an eating disorder,\" said Sarah Chase, vice president of communication for NEDA.

The computer is only months old, so a price cut of just under $100 is definitely worth paying attention to \\u2014 especially since it makes a return to its lowest price ever. Functionally, it's not all that different from the M1 Mac mini, but it does have a slight edge in processor speed \\u2014 and its starting price is $100 lower than the M1.

We like the 9th generation because it doesn't come with the bumped-up price of last fall's 10th gen release, instead keeping things firmly in the entry-level tablet range. Despite not being the latest iteration, it still has up to 10 hours of battery life, a 10.2-inch Retina display, and more than enough processing power to get you through most standard tasks.

And boy, are they worth it.The JBL Tune wireless headphones are equipped with JBL's signature pure bass sound, which is a must for EDM music lovers. You can wear them wireless or wired, depending on your preference (and battery levels, tbh!), and you also get active noise cancelation for busy streets. They last about 35 hours when ANC is on, but a whopping 50 hours with it off, so you don't have to worry about running out of juice.A cool feature of these headphones is that you can connect to two devices via Bluetooth at the same time (Apple famously does not let you do that!), so you can watch a video on your tablet and effortlessly switch to your phone if you get a call. While there's no app, you can still make adjustments to volume, bass, noise canceling, and more through the buttons on the super comfy padded ear cups. They also take only about two hours to charge fully, which is pretty great for a pair of headphones at this price.Snag the JBL Tune wireless headphones on sale now for 19% off, and ditch your old wired option stat.", "link": "https://mashable.com/deals/april-18-jbl-deal-amazon", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 16:53:14 +0000"}, {"title": "You can add up to 5 links to your Instagram bio now", "description": "Someone check in on Linktree because it might soon be obsolete.Instagram users can now add up to five links in their profile bios, a massive increase from the previous one single link, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced via his Broadcast Channel on Tuesday.\\xa0Instagram has been testing the tool for some time now.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Instagram Reels launches new metrics and trending audio\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe feature is available for all accounts, including business and creators, but you'll need to update your app to ensure you have access.

An AI-generated track called \"Heart On My Sleeve\" mimics the two hitmakers so well that it's gone viral. And that, naturally, has caused some controversy. (If you'd like to hear it, click here.)The song really does sound like an offering from Drake and The Weeknd. It even has some interesting subtext. The faux song twice mentions Selena Gomez, who reportedly used to date The Weeknd. A fake Drake lyric about Gomez even name-checks her other ex, Justin Bieber. Raps the AI Drake: \"I came in with my ex like Selena to flex, ay / Bumpin' Justin Bieber the fever ain't left, ay.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            TikTok removes viral video ad of suspected Joe Rogan AI deepfake\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe song was created by an anonymous creator name Ghostwriter, and it began picking up steam on streaming services earlier this week before being taken down. Still, the song is floating around YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and elsewhere. Universal Music Group criticized the fake song in a statement given to Billboard. \"The training of generative AI using our artists' music (which represents both a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law) as well as the availability of infringing content created with generative AI on DSPs, begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation,\" a UMG spokesman told Billboard. \"We're encouraged by the engagement of our platform partners on these issues \\u2013 as they recognize they need to be part of the solution.\"It's no surprise that the track has been getting pulled from streaming services and various other platforms including YouTube due to copyright violations. Yet, the scariest part of this story is that the song from AI Drake and AI The Weeknd is honestly...not bad. It sounds like a legit hit from the duo. There is really no way to know for certain that it isn't the real Drake or Weeknd on the song just by listening, and that could have some unsettling implications. Now, to be clear, we know very little about the creation of this song and what went into it. We don't know what kind of AI, if any, was actually used in the process. We just know what the track sounded like and that it wasn't actually from the two artists. Of course, voice synthesis has come a long way, so it's not hard to believe the song is truly AI-created. Viral TikToks, for instance, regularly feature faux versions of celebs \\u2014 chiefly President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \\u2014 arguing with one another about inane topics. So, where does the music industry go from here? Will it resist generative AI, or will it become a lucrative tool for artists and labels?

Starship, SpaceX's skyscraping rocket and spacecraft, will launch on its first mission soon. During the test flight, the colossal booster will separate about three minutes after liftoff and land in the Gulf of Mexico, according to federal filings. The ship will fly in space around Earth at an altitude of over 150 miles, then splash down off the Hawaiian coast. The whole thing will last about 1.5 hours, if it goes as planned. This will be a crucial demonstration of hardware that NASA is depending on to get humans back on the moon in the next few years. And, if successful, it'll mean Musk is one small step closer to realizing his personal dream of building a city on Mars. \\nUPDATE: Apr. 18, 2023, 10:46 a.m. EDT After a scrubbed launch attempt on April 17, SpaceX will try again to send its enormous Starship on a test flight in space on Thursday, April 20, 2023. The first try transitioned to a countdown and fueling rehearsal after a pressure issue was discovered. The Thursday launch window opens at 9:28 a.m. ET and will last 1 hour and two minutes. \\n\\nThe billionaire business magnate has oversold timelines in the past, but here's what we know so far. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How a NASA nuclear rocket engine could unleash the solar system\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nWhat is the SpaceX Starship? Starship is a super-heavy-lift rocket and spacecraft, built to carry immense cargo and numerous astronauts into deep space. The 400-foot-tall stainless steel tower looms over NASA's rocket, the Space Launch System. It would take about five billboards stacked on top of the latter to measure up to Musk's space vehicle. SpaceX estimates its rocket also has about twice as much thrust.The rocket is made of stainless steel, a material Musk is particularly fond of due to its relatively low price. Unlike NASA's mega moon rocket, which flies on super-chilled liquid hydrogen and oxygen, this beast is fueled with 10 million pounds of liquid methane and oxygen. The new fuel can be stored at more manageable temperatures than liquid hydrogen, meaning it doesn't need as much insulation and is less prone to leaks, a problem that often stymies NASA launches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpaceX's Starship is made of stainless steel and runs on liquid methane.\\nCredit: SpaceX\\n\\n\\nStarship is intended to evolve into a fully reusable launch and landing system, designed for trips to the moon, Mars, and other destinations. Its reusability is \"the holy grail of space,\" Musk said at a company event in South Texas in February 2022, because it will make spaceflight more affordable to the average person. \"It's a very hard thing to do,\" he said. \"It's only barely possible with the physics of Earth.\" \\n    \"It's only barely possible with the physics of Earth.\" \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNASA tapped SpaceX to develop a human landing system version of Starship.\\nCredit: SpaceX \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow will NASA use Starship? NASA plans to use Starships to land astronauts on the moon during Artemis III and IV, two upcoming missions which could come as early as 2025 and 2028, respectively. The space agency has tapped SpaceX to develop a human landing system version of Starship with a $4 billion contract. As part of the deal, the company will need to demonstrate an uncrewed test flight to the moon beforehand.During Artemis III, Starship will transfer astronauts from NASA's Orion spacecraft to the lunar south pole and back. But in the fourth mission, Starship is expected to dock at a moon-orbiting space station, the yet-to-be-built Gateway, and ferry astronauts back and forth to the moon. \\n\\n\\nNASA administrator Bill Nelson told reporters in December that SpaceX appears to be on schedule with the contract and intends to do an uncrewed moon landing toward the end of this year. That mission would be followed by another landing with astronauts in late 2024. \"Slips are always possible because it's a brand new system,\" Nelson said. \"But they have been quite impressive with what they have done with other systems.\" \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nWhen is Starship's first space launch?In order for Starship to actually reach ignition, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must license the launch. That key approval happened just recently on Friday, April 14, 2023, giving the public little notice of the company's plan to try to launch three days later on Monday, April, 17. But SpaceX stopped the countdown clock prematurely to investigate a pressure issue found in the first stage of the rocket. The next try will happen Thursday, April 20, with a launch window between 9:28 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. ET. Shortly into January, the company stacked the jumbo rocket at its launch pad on Texas' Gulf Coast, then loaded it with fuel for a so-called \"wet dress rehearsal.\" SpaceX said the test, a key practice run for any new rocket, was successful. The team disassembled Starship for a test fire of the rocket booster's 33 Raptor engines. Musk said 31 of the 33 engines fired for the full duration of the ground test \\u2014 \"still enough engines to reach orbit,\" Musk tweeted on Feb. 9. \\n    \"Slips are always possible because it's a brand new system. But they have been quite impressive with what they have done with other systems.\" \\n    \\nWhere will Starship launch? Perhaps surprisingly, Starship won't lift off from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where most space fans are accustomed to watching historically significant launches. Instead, it will take off from Boca Chica, Texas, at SpaceX's own spaceport. Eventually, the company will launch the rocket from a site under construction in the outer perimeter of the famous Florida pad that shot Apollo 11 to the moon. \"Their plan is that they're going to do a few test flights there,\" in South Texas, Nelson said. \"Once they have the confidence, they will bring the missions to the Cape.\" Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox?

If you're not on the list to get onto SpaceX's private Starbase but you're in the South Texas area, you could try viewing the flight test from a public beach on South Padre Island, such as Isla Blanca Park.For viewers at home, SpaceX intends to start a live broadcast of the launch countdown beginning 45 minutes before liftoff, which could start as early as 8:43 a.m. ET. To watch a livestream of the event, the feed will be available here on Youtube: \\n\\n\\nHow likely is Starship to succeed? SpaceX has launched partial prototypes of Starship to practice landing, and several exploded or crashed in the process. One succeeded in returning unscathed, however, in May 2021, after flying about six miles up in the sky.Musk, who doesn't parse words when it comes to the realities of spaceflight, once said Starship's test in space wasn't likely to succeed on the first try. \\n    \"There's a lot of risk associated with this first launch, so I would not say that it is likely to be successful.\"\\n    \\n\"There's a lot of risk associated with this first launch, so I would not say that it is likely to be successful,\" he said during a video conference with a National Academies panel in 2021. \"But I think we will make a lot of progress.\"\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nWhat is SpaceX's plan for Mars? The SpaceX founder's ultimate vision is to use a fleet of Starships to send 1 million humans to Mars by 2050. To be clear, Musk doesn't just want to establish a place for people to visit but a self-sustaining city. He imagines that, with a bit of warming, humans could restore a thick atmosphere and oceans on Mars, making it a more hospitable environment, even able to grow crops.\"There's a fundamental juncture in the history of really any civilization on a single planet, which is, do you get to the second planet, or do you not?\" Musk told the National Academies in 2021. \"I propose we do, and I think we should as soon as possible.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpaceX test fired a Starship prototype spacecraft on the ground in December.\\nCredit: SpaceX\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"There's a fundamental juncture in the history of really any civilization on a single planet, which is, do you get to the second planet, or do you not?\"\\n    \\nThe spacecraft would be spacious enough for 100 passengers, along with their luggage, plus the materials to build homes, businesses, rocket fuel stations, and iron foundries. The journey getting there would be long, Musk said, but the Starship would have entertainment, such as zero-gravity games, movies, lectures, and a restaurant. \"It can't feel cramped or boring,\" he said at the International Astronautical Congress in 2016, in Guadalajara, Mexico. \"It'll be really fun to go. You'll have a great time.\"Note: This article was originally published Feb. 4, 2023.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/spacex-starship-launch-date", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 16:09:16 +0000"}, {"title": "YouTube legends Jacksepticeye and CrankGameplays on their new podcast 'Brain Leak'", "description": "Do you ever feel like your brain juice is just...leaking? Like all your wackiest thoughts and weirdest ideas are oozing out of the silliest shaped holes in your skull? That's the idea behind the new unscripted and unfiltered podcast Brain Leak, hosted by YouTube creators and besties Se\\xe1n McLoughlin (known as Jacksepticeye) and Ethan Nestor (a.k.a. CrankGameplays). The pair have never had a problem filtering themselves before \\u2014 they're beloved for exuberant and sometimes off-the-rails gaming reactions and collabs \\u2014 but on Brain Leak they're really getting candid. Each episode is a bemusing ping pong match between two delightfully irreverent bros and their bonkers brains.\\n\\n\\nThe pod is produced by content studio QCODE (whom the guys tip their proverbial hats to for \"letting the word vomit flow\") and premiers tomorrow, April 19, across all major podcast platforms and a new Brain Leak YouTube channel.Before the release, McLoughlin and Nestor sat down with Mashable to talk about how the podcast has reignited their creativity and scratched a super specific brain itch.Mashable: I've listened to the first episode and, as someone who also has ADHD, I adore the idea that it's basically a long ploy for the two of you to finally just hang out.Se\\xe1n McLoughlin: We've both listened to podcasts for a while, and I've always been interested in doing one but never really knew what to do. It always felt like there had to be a plan or a big gimmick to it. And I was like, \"I just want to hang out and chat and have fun and try and make each other laugh for like an hour every week.\"Ethan Nestor: And it's not just the the audio podcast that we're excited about. We're pumped about the other things that we're able to make branching off the podcast, like visiting the Blarney Stone or bringing Se\\xe1n to Maine and going on a lobster boat or something. It's honestly just an excuse for us to be able to hang out more and do stupid shit.SM: We're terrible at keeping up with each other so this forces us to still be friends.The best way to do that is to put something on the calendar as a work obligation.SM: [The podcast] will tear us apart because now it's just for work.EN: Yeah, we're contractually obligated to be friends.How many episodes have you recorded so far?SM: We have five done now. We wanted to get some of the teething issues out of the way before we release them fully.Did you say teething, like a baby teething?SM: Yeah! We're babies. We don't know what we're doing. And because Ethan's quite busy leading up to his Creator Clash thing, and I've been traveling back and forth a lot, we banked a few of episodes. I think the next ones we'll probably do more in real-time where we get audience feedback. As the episodes go, we have more serious episodes where we kind of just talked about our youth and school days, and then we have others where we don't talk about anything serious for an hour and a half. We also have our terrible advice segment that's kicking off now. We're getting feedback, tweets, and actual audience interaction which we didn't really have for the first episode. I think as we ease into it, it's our excuse to let intrusive thoughts out. Whenever people ask for advice on something, it's like our excuse to be assholes for no reason.The podcast is an excuse to be assholes for no reason?SM: If I did it on my channel, I'd be canceled. But if I do it on a podcast, it's funny [laughs]. I think when you're listening to the podcast, you know, it's a different space than if you were watching a YouTube video, or playing a game and trying to talk at the same time. And the fact that there's two of us, we just bounce off each other and if a person laughs then that's fine. I just hear laughter and I know it's good.How long have you guys known each other?SM: We met at PAX East in Boston in 2015. We used to go to those and do meet and greets and panels and meet fans and stuff. I met Ethan at [Markiplier's]\\xa0panel where he did a backflip and then gave me a hug. That sticks with you.EN: Different times, truly.Why was it a different time?EN: I think that the community was just a bit different back then. Everyone was a bit more, I don't know, it was still a little bit of the Wild West of YouTube. There was still a lot of \\u2013 in good ways and bad ways \\u2014 people idolizing YouTubers back then. And so people were more prone to going out to conventions to see YouTubers and wait in line and stuff like that. It was still a bit more rare to be a content creator on the internet. And now I feel like everyone is streaming.SM: Back then, people weren't really doing brand deals on YouTube videos, there was no copyright system the way it is now; the whole landscape has changed. People would only make money through ad revenue. It was very bizarre to do like a 60-second integration at the start your videos, that was unheard of.EN: People thought you were a bit of a sellout if you did brand deals back then.Se\\xe1n, in the first episode you said you'd been feeling like you are in a rut in terms of content creation.SM: Yeah, I do that. That's just my thing.EN: [Laughs] Seasonal content depression.SM: I think last year because of a lot of personal stuff happening around me, like friends moving away and people hanging out in person again, I was like, \"Man, I don't have anyone that I can go meet,\" and I still wasn't able to travel because we didn't have time to do it. There was a lot of stuff in my head that got to me, and then I got back into therapy, started a new medication, and now everything's great.I don't think the podcast came out of that directly, but I want to try harder to do all the things that I've wanted to do that I keep putting off. I just want to have more fun and not worry. After [being a content creator] for 10 years, it feels monotonous and like a cycle, it feels a lot like work. Trying new things, making it interesting again, having fun with it, and not really having to worry about things as much is my goal for this year.What are some of the things on that list?EN: It's less of a list and more of a scroll.SM: YouTubers just always have shit they want to do. I wanted to do a narrative podcast as well at some point with a story I had in mind. Comic books are something that I've been interested in. TV shows, movies\\u2026 I want to do it all, but I need to make sure that I'm taking the time to figure out which ones are best to do right now. If I jump in and try and do all of them all at the same time, then I hate myself and none of them actually get done.EN: I think that having another person to bounce off of, to keep you accountable, is so helpful for my brain. That was one of the reasons why Unus Annus worked was because I had to do stuff with another person. Sometimes the shared misery is nice. Se\\xe1n and I have such good chemistry and our brains are the exact same. So it's super easy to make stuff when we both have a little mirror that we can shout into.That practice, called mirroring or body doubling, has been shown to help people with ADHD focus.SM: That's how I operate. Because if I do it on my own, I get nothing done. But then me and my girlfriend go to a coffee shop and sit down and I'll just start typing suddenly.EN: I used to do that all the time. Back when I still edited my own stuff I would get on Skype with a couple of my friends and we would edit our videos together. And none of us would ever say anything, but it was nice to just be existing alongside another person.Is there anything else you want to share about the podcast? EN: Obviously, Se\\xe1n and I don't live in the same place so we won't be able to record [in the same physical space] super often. And so when we do get to do that, it'll be a fun little gift for the audience. I'm really hoping that that the community gets excited about it. It'll be like a little Christmas every time those videos get uploaded.SM: There's a big tendency on YouTube these days to get things right when you're uploading them. The title and the thumbnail have to be incredible. The idea has to be really good. It has to be super re-watchable, it has to be retention-based. But for us, [the format of this podcast is] more interesting because we don't think about any of that. I think that's more exciting because it feels like old-school YouTube where you just go and see what happens.EN: At the end of the day, we just want to be as accessible as possible because it's just going to be Se\\xe1n and I hanging out. And we know that our communities will like that a lot. We didn't really want the podcast to have a schtick because it can kind of get old after a while.SM: Yeah, because I think we have a tendency \\u2014 again with ADHD \\u2014 to outgrow our schticks. It always amazes me how many creators have ADHD because, like you said, it's hard to focus. But both of you have still been have been able to produce so much content and build entire careers.SM: We get bored way too quick. Ethan's decided to get punched in the face repeatedly. I'm very excited to watch him throw hands.I hate fighting, so I'll just have to see afterwards if he got knocked out or not.SM: It's OK. We'll have a podcast episode on it. If he wins, we'll celebrate, and if he loses I'll make fun of him.EN: We'll record it immediately after, and we'll call it like \"the concussion-sode.\"SM: We'll turn it into content.EN: That's right.

Isn't that why the robot vacuum has become a well-loved household tool over the past decade?Then, the inevitable happened: Hybrid models, which add mopping to the menu. The best robot vacuum and mop hybrids can suck and scrub for a 2-in-1 deep clean. Sounds too good to be true, right?Mopping may be the newest front in the robot vacuum wars, but here\\u2019s an open secret: Many hybrid vacuum/mops aren\\u2019t very good at either. You end up getting a mediocre vacuum and a mediocre mop for twice the price.Think back to the Swiffer. That $20 hand mop might be annoying to use, but it handily outperforms most robot mops, which can cost anywhere from $300-$1,500.Fortunately, there are some excellent robot mops, and the best robot vacuums and mop products easily passed our cleaning tests. After testing out the top hybrid robot vacuum/mops from iRobot, Shark, eufy, and RoboRock, we\\u2019ve ranked the top options for your home.Are mopping robots worth it?A mopping robot's value is pretty indisputable \\u2014 if it can actually mop as well as it promises. Most robot mops include a disclaimer along these lines: \\u201cNot meant to be used for stubborn, sticky, or set-in stains.\\u201d Of course, those types of floor stains are the exact reason you own a mop in the first place. So if you want to invest in a robot vacuum and mop, we recommend avoiding most budget models in favor of more advanced cleaning bots.The traditional mop and bucket is a logistical headache, and constantly tossing out Swiffer pads feels wasteful. If you're going to pay to take the tedious motion of vacuuming off of your to-do list, you may as well let the same bot finish the job with a nice sparkle. The best robot vacuum and mops may not scrub with as much oomph as your own two hands, but they can make your floors shine a bit more than they normally would.How do robot vacuum mops work?At their core, robot vacuum-mop combos are really just robot vacuums with an attached water reservoir and scrubbing pad. Thus, they work just like robot vacuums but dispense water for mopping when they're not sucking up dust. When you want to finish your freshly-vacuumed floors with a shine, you fill the water tank up and attach a cloth or pad to the bottom and the bot will navigate your floors to clean up the extra dirt. Some, of course, are better than others about lifting the cloth when they approach carpet and ceasing water flow automatically.For the most effective clean, look for models that can accommodate cleaning fluid in addition to regular water. Likewise, robot mops that incorporate a scrubbing motion will do a better job at lifting away dirt and grime.What to look for in a robot vacuum mop comboChoosing the best robot vacuum mop for you really depends on your lifestyle and the budget you\\u2019re looking to stick with. Whether you\\u2019re looking for something that will tackle big messes with ease, or something that you can set and forget, there are a few key factors to keep in mind:Battery life: If you\\u2019re hoping to swap your mop and bucket for a hybrid robot vacuum, the device you choose should have the battery life to cover your entire surface area. A 100-minute battery life should be sufficient for most apartments, or if most of your cleaning will be done on a room-by-room basis. Battery life of 170 to 200 minutes isn't hard to find and would be ideal for square footage over 1,500. The best robot vacuums recharge on their own and automatically resume cleaning.Floor-type sensors: A robot vacuum's ability to adjust suction based on floor type is important even just in the dry sweeping realm. But for robot mops, this is what will keep your carpets from getting soggy. Most hybrids automatically start to mop once their water tank is attached, but only the smarter ones know to pause the water flow and lift their wet cloth above the carpet. Bots that remember your rooms or follow virtual boundaries can be programmed to avoid carpeted areas while mopping altogether. Smart mapping: A robot vacuum's navigation tech decides whether or not it's equipped to adhere to virtual boundaries (or stuck with those ugly magnetic strips). Currently, the golden standard is LiDAR: a laser that scans different points in your home to determine where walls are. Once the robot vacuum has made its rounds and gotten its bearings, it draws a floor plan that you can refer to in the app to send the bot to clean specific rooms or set up zones that you'd like the bot to avoid, like a pile of toys or your pet's water bowl.Dust bin size and self-emptying: You\\u2019ll want to make sure the dust bin and water reservoir in your robot vacuum-mop combo are an appropriate match for your home. If you\\u2019re living in a condo, apartment, or other small space, you probably won\\u2019t need a massive vacuum reservoir. If you\\u2019re hoping to cover an entire house, you\\u2019ll probably want to look for something that you won\\u2019t have to empty out after every single cleaning session. A self-emptying vacuum will come in clutch here, which automatically empties its debris into a dock and leaves you off the hook for a month or two.Keep in mind that most hybrid robot vacuums and mops are available in both self-emptying and automatic models. Because the automatic models are usually about $200 cheaper, we\\u2019ve included more of them here. However, if self-emptying is important to you, then you\\u2019ll want to spring for pricier bots like the Ecovacs X1 Omni or the Roomba Combo j7+.All things considered, which hybrid model is the best?Below, we\\u2019re outlining some of the best robot mop combos on the market right now \\u2014\\xa0including the standout features that set them apart.If a model listed below looks awesome but out of your price range, click on it! Amazon is known to inflate original prices and keep things permanently on sale for upwards of $200 off. Plus, you might be able to find a cheaper version without self-emptying. Even the best robot vacuum and mop devices go on sale, and there\\u2019s a hybrid cleaner for everyone\\u2019s budget.", "link": "https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:47:23 +0000"}, {"title": "iMessage's invisible ink puts the fun in functional", "description": "My finger hovers over an iMessage obscured by a haze of dancing white dots. Before I tap to dissolve the sparkling pixels and reveal the contents of the message, I know it's going to be juicy, or at the very least entertaining. That's the allure of iMessage's most underrated function: invisible ink.\\xa0When you send a message or photo with invisible ink, the words and images are atomized only to be revealed with the swipe of a finger. It gives the allusion of security; taking a screenshot of it is a challenge but not impossible. The use of invisible ink also breaks up the monotony of texting. Text messages, unlike face-to-face conversations, are anything but ephemeral. They live on the recipient's phone forever, begging to be saved in your camera roll or shown to someone else. Invisible ink signals that you don't want whatever you said repeated, creating a sense of intimacy and code of conduct.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            On TikTok, 'The Hunger Games' is a metaphor for our modern dystopia\\n            \\n\\n\\nInvisible ink launched in 2016 with other iMessage Bubble and Screen effects, including gentle and slam, but the other effects have yet to have the utility or cultural impact of invisible ink. Invisible ink is no longer just an iMessage utility but part of the internet's larger vernacular, an indicator of its impact on the way we communicate and how we decide what is secret or too much information to share. For example, Twitter users preface their more controversial or out-of-pocket opinions with the disclaimer \"sent with invisible ink.\"\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nOn average, Gen Z has 96 unread text messages on their phones and millennials have 51, yet the average screen time for Americans is 4.8 hours a day, suggesting a nationwide case of texting fatigue. In 2022, The New York Times declared the group chat dead after our collective reliance on it during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, texting and group chats have endured largely because we've found innovative ways to make them more dynamic through inventive emoji use, voice notes, and invisible ink. Faced with seemingly endless messages on Slack, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, invisible ink is a way for me to liven up texting and differentiate between work and pleasure.\"[I use invisible ink] in normal texts to create that aura of suspense,\" Emma Hashemi tells Mashable. The 23-year-old technology risk consultant based in San Francisco, California also employs invisible ink for silly stuff she might be embarrassed about or to surprise the recipient. It's a way to announce I'm going to be unhinged for a moment, don't hold what I am about to say against me, or here's some tea that I can't risk sending out in the open.\\xa0When Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn broke up, I sent devastating edits and tweets in invisible ink prefaced by \"tw taylor and joe break up\" to a group chat of fellow Taylor Swift fans out of respect for their emotional wellbeing. In another one of my group chats, it's customary to send all photos of actor Logan Lerman in invisible ink because a face like that can catch you off guard.\\xa0\\n    It's a way to announce 'I'm going to be unhinged for a moment, don't hold what I am about to say against me,' or 'here's some tea that I can't risk sending out in the open.'\\n    \\nThe appeal of invisible ink goes beyond its contents. The effect in itself is enticing. Max Porto, a 25-year-old student in Brooklyn, New York, \"gets a dopamine rush from swiping away the invisible ink.\"But invisible ink doesn't just break up the boring streams of texts; its functionality is an ally of gossips everywhere. \"I use invisible ink to gossip about people who are also in the room,\" Joyce Cam, a 24-year-old marketing administrator from Portland, Oregon, tells Mashable. It's also a method to keep talking shit about someone even when you know the recipient is with the subject of your rant. \"It rocks when you don't want people to read over your shoulder. For example, if you're in an audience setting and the guy behind you is having a weird conversation and you want to tell your friend without him being able to read over your shoulder,\" explains another invisible ink aficionado to Mashable.\\xa0Invisible ink is also a tool to discuss spoilers in group chats where not everyone is caught up, explains 22-year-old Mary Niarhos, who uses it when Succession airs. Similarly, it's used to send your Wordle score without revealing the word to those who haven't played yet. It's also utilized to send sexy messages and nudes.\\xa0\\xa0Invisible ink is closely related to another texting trend: censoring names or phrases for dramatic effect. \"My friends and I will often censor the names of people we collectively dislike,\" explains Cam. She gave the example of replacing the letters of someone's name with asterisks when announcing the person's pregnancy to the group chat. Another strategy is to use [redacted] instead of a name or phrase. Self-censorship in private channels feels weird, but it adds flavor to text messages and is likely a result of so much of our daily communication occurring over work channels monitored by employers on Slack and Microsoft Teams.\\xa0As we continue to conduct so much of our social interactions online, people will find even more creative uses for app functionalities like invisible ink. And our text communication will be better \\u2014 and way more fun if not slightly absurd \\u2014 because of it.

This is difficult to validate and prove, Bumble and supporters say, and would give room for those who cyberflash to claim it was a \"joke.\"Instead, Bumble's campaigning for the cyberflashing portion of OSB to be consent-based. \"The proposed cyberflashing legislation is based on proving malicious intent, which is out of step with other proposed and existing sexual violence laws,\" said cyberflashing expert, professor Clare McGlynn, in a press release. \"This approach will leave a loophole in the law, ultimately making prosecutions against cyberflashing unlikely whilst protecting men and allowing them to claim a defense of 'it was a joke' or 'I was having a laugh.'\"Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox?

It could be a roadtrip to a new part of Australia you haven\\u2019t seen yet, or a much-awaited post-covid overseas trip. There\\u2019s a lot of stress when it comes to planning your perfect holiday. There is accommodation to consider, routes, activities to do and landmarks to see. You\\u2019ve done some preliminary googling, and on every other hotel or airline website you see one name pop up time and time again: Tripadvisor. With more than 20 years in the travel business, Tripadvisor has made a name for itself worldwide as a one-stop-shop destination for travellers online. If you\\u2019ve never used the service before, or you have a few questions, read on to find out everything you need to know about tripadvisor.com.au.What is Tripadvisor?Tripadvisor is a popular travel website that provides information and reviews of travel-related content. Launched in February 2000, Tripadvisor has become one of the largest travel websites in the world, allowing travellers to search for hotels, restaurants, attractions, and other travel-related content in thousands of popular travel destinations. Users can also share their own experiences by writing reviews, posting photos, and giving ratings to the places they have visited. These user reviews make up the bedrock of Tripadvisor\\u2019s value to travellers, with a huge community of users giving honest feedback, which can help you avoid common mistakes and \\u201ctourist traps\\u201d. You can also find forums, travel guides, and booking options for flights, hotels, and rental cars. Overall, Tripadvisor aims to provide a comprehensive resource for travellers to plan and book their trips.Is Tripadvisor a travel agency?Tripadvisor is not a travel agency in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a travel website that provides information, reviews, and booking options for travellers. Tripadvisor does not directly offer or sell travel services, such as flights, hotels, or vacation packages, but instead acts as a platform for travellers to research and plan their trips. However, Tripadvisor partners with third-party providers such as online travel agencies, airlines, and hotels. This means that ultimately, you can use Tripadvisor to research, plan, and book your trips, but you will need to use third-party providers to complete the bookings. And while Tripadvisor has historically been used primarily for flights and accommodation, these days you can also use it to find activities and experiences in your chosen destination, with some great deals and benefits to speak of.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Tripadvisor\\n\\n\\nWhy book experiences through Tripadvisor?Within the \\u2018Things To Do\\u2019 section of the Tripadvisor website or app, you\\u2019ll find curated lists of activities you can expect to find in your chosen destination. These often include scenic tours, museums and galleries, cultural and educational experiences, and local delicacies. If you\\u2019re a little lost on where you should go and what you should see, and if you want to make the most of what limited time you have on your travels, this is a great place to start. Tripadvisor carefully selects the providers and tourism agencies it works with to ensure they meet high standards of quality and safety. This can give you peace of mind knowing you're booking with a reputable provider. It also just provides a really user-friendly experience, with instant confirmation and the ability to manage your booking online. If you\\u2019re travelling on a budget, Tripadvisor can both help you save money with lowest price guarantees, some free 24-hour cancellations, and with user reviews (which can help you decide which expensive attractions to avoid, and which free attractions to not miss). There are also countless blogs and guides from users to help inspire you on your travels, like this article on \\u201cThe Perfect 2 Days in London\\u201d, that not only present you with a well-written travel story, but with links to booking those same experiences in the moment you are inspired by them.Why book hotels through Tripadvisor?Booking hotels through Tripadvisor can offer a convenient way to keep all your travel plans together and get a great deal, with access to a wealth of information and options to help you navigate your burgeoning itinerary. Tripadvisor offers a vast selection of hotels and accommodation to choose from, all in one place. With an extensive database of user-generated reviews and ratings to help you determine the quality of a hotel, the amenities offered, and the overall guest experience. Tripadvisor also allows you to compare prices from multiple booking sites, which can help you find the best deal on your hotel stay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Tripadvisor\\n\\n\\nIs it safe to buy tickets with Tripadvisor?Tripadvisor doesn\\u2019t sell you tickets directly, but partners with third-party providers such as airlines, online travel agencies, and other booking platforms to offer tickets, accommodation and experiences to its users. When you click on the \"Book Now\" or \"Check Prices\" button on Tripadvisor, you will be directed to the website of the third-party provider to complete your booking. One benefit of Tripadvisor is that you are only looking at options that have been verified by both the travel website, and the scores of user reviews that are front and centre before you make any purchasing decisions. And while Tripadvisor works to ensure the safety and security of its users by only partnering with reputable providers, as with any online transaction, it is important to use caution and follow best practices to protect your personal and financial information. Additionally, use secure payment methods such as credit cards or PayPal and avoid sharing sensitive information such as your bank account details.

There are plenty of far-out concepts and such out there, but today we\\u2019re focusing on devices that might actually make it into consumers\\u2019 hands this year. Companies like Samsung, Google, and maybe even Apple have all been tied to new foldable devices.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            OnePlus will launch its first foldable phone this year\\n            \\n\\n\\nWithout wasting any more time, here are the big foldable devices you can realistically expect to see in 2023.Oppo Find N2 FlipOur first foldable is one that\\u2019s actually already out in most of the world. Chinese tech giant Oppo released its Find N2 Flip phone \\u201cglobally\\u201d in February, but \\u201cglobally\\u201d doesn\\u2019t include North America. Sadly, there\\u2019s no indication this phone will come stateside just yet.Still, it looks pretty cool. It\\u2019s a clamshell style foldable a la the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, with a sizable 3.26-inch cover screen on the outside to show you notifications and whatnot while the phone is closed. Unfold the Find N2 and you\\u2019ll unveil a 6.8-inch, 120Hz display.Sadly, for now, all we can do in North America is sit and stare at a phone we can\\u2019t buy.\\xa0Motorola Razr\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 2020 Razr looked cool, but had some big problems.\\nCredit: Zlata Ivleva/Mashable\\n\\n\\nNow we\\u2019re in somewhat speculative territory. Motorola confirmed just this week to CNBC that it would release a new version of the foldable Razr in 2023.\\xa0And that\\u2019s about it. No other details were given about how the phone would improve upon its predecessors. Motorola updated the Razr with a bigger display last year, but that version was only released in Europe and China. The first foldable Razr was a big disappointment at the time, as our review unit quickly started making a wholly unpleasant noise every time you folded the phone.\\xa0There aren't a great deal of reliable leaks about the new Razr to chew on, either. Prolific leaker Evan Blass (as spotted by TechRadar) reported back in February that the new Razr would have an exterior display that almost takes up the entire outer face of the phone, which would be a big step up from before. Exterior displays on clamshell foldables haven't quite lived up to their potential in terms of usefulness, so more size is always welcome.Hopefully the new Razr avoids the pitfalls of its predecessors and actually comes to the states this time. Since the last update happened in August of 2022, it might be reasonable to expect a similar timeframe for the new Razr.OnePlusOnePlus is in the same boat as Motorola, in that we know a phone is coming, but don\\u2019t know anything about it.The subsidiary of Oppo confirmed earlier this week that it will launch its first foldable in 2023, but declined to share any other concrete details. The company said it wants the phone to be sleek and fast, though I imagine most phone companies would say the same about their products.\\xa0We\\u2019ll just have to wait and see on this one. Sadly, we don't know yet when we'll see the OnePlus foldable. It might have to wait until the second half of 2023.Samsung Galaxy foldablesOne thing we can be a lot more sure about is Samsung\\u2019s commitment to the foldable game. After all, it\\u2019s been one of the only companies to not only launch multiple foldable devices, but keep upgrading them on an annual basis until they actually became pretty good to use.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 makes tablets a thing of the past\\n            \\n\\n\\nLast year\\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 4 (that\\u2019s the one that\\u2019s like a small tablet) and Z Flip 4 (that\\u2019s the one that\\u2019s a clamshell) were both quality devices that found their own niches in the phone market. We can almost certainly expect updates to both phones later this year, most likely around August.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nLeaks point to a bigger outside cover screen and improved inside crease for the Z Flip 5. Aside from that, one can reasonably expect camera and processor improvements to both phones.But wait, there\\u2019s more! Samsung (allegedly) isn\\u2019t done yet. Samsung has been rumored to be working on a foldable tablet for a couple of years now, and a leak spotted by 9to5Google late last year suggested it could come out in the first half of 2023. Maybe there will be a third device in the Samsung foldable family this August.Pixel Fold?Now we\\u2019re in the \\u201cwe\\u2019ve been hearing about it for so long that it should really come out this year\\u201d portion of the list. First up is Google\\u2019s rumored Pixel Fold device.Rumors first started circulating all the way back in 2021 that Google was exploring a foldable Pixel, but Google hasn\\u2019t formally announced it yet. Last year, Front Page Tech shared leaked renders that purported to show the phone\\u2019s design. It looks similar to the Galaxy Z Fold, as it has roughly the shape of a normal smartphone while closed, and looks more like a small tablet while open. It also might cost $1,800.Additional reporting from 9to5Google suggests that it will be heavier than the Z Fold 4, but will also have a larger battery. If these rumors are to be believed, we could see the Pixel Fold as early as May at Google I/O. A recent New York Times report also backed up the notion that the Pixel Fold could come out this year, so watch out, folks.Apple?When it comes to innovative tech, everyone\\u2019s eyes are always on Apple. When will the folks in Cupertino embrace foldable displays, and how will they put their stamp on the idea?We don\\u2019t know that for sure just yet, but rumors suggest that Apple is working on at least one foldable device right now. Reputable analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo have alleged that Apple is working on a foldable iPhone, but it could be the far-flung future of 2025 before it actually comes out. It could also be some kind of hybrid phone/tablet.Or, Apple could make both a foldable iPhone and a foldable iPad. Kuo has separately stated that a foldable iPad may be in the works, but a 2023 launch is not set in stone. It could be early 2024 before we see that.\\xa0Still, Apple fanatics can rest assured that a foldable device is probably on the way.A Microsoft foldable?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new Surface Duo might not be so \"duo\" after all.\\nCredit: Molly Flores/Mashable\\n\\n\\nLast but not least, Microsoft is apparently working on a foldable device of its own. More specifically, it\\u2019s taking a previous device that wasn\\u2019t foldable and making it foldable.Windows Central reported in January that the next evolution of the Surface Duo device line will have a real foldable display, with a 180-degree hinge and another, smaller display on the outside of the device. Previous iterations of the Surface Duo worked similarly to something like the Galaxy Z Fold, but there were actually two entirely separate screens with some space in between them, rather than one screen that folded.And now for the bad news: Microsoft reportedly scrapped plans for another two-screen phone in order to make this new foldable version happen, which means that it might not see the light of day until 2024. Anything is possible, but don\\u2019t get your hopes up, Windows-heads.\\xa0", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/foldable-devices-coming-2023", "pubDate": "Tue, 18 Apr 2023 10:00:01 +0000"}, {"title": "This galactic collision made a blast brighter than 1 trillion suns", "description": "The James Webb Space Telescope is observing what happens when two spiral galaxies crash into each other, and the result is something as bright as a trillion suns.

So many games today have incredible sound and music, whether it's the booming score of God of War Ragnarok or whizzing rockets in Call of Duty: Warzone, the right headset can pull you deeper into the worlds you're exploring on the screen.

If you're on a budget or are looking for the best audio experience you can get no matter the cost, there's a headset that can provide that extra oomph for your gaming sessions.Can I use a gaming headset on both console and PC?More often than not, yes, you can. As long as your console and PC both have compatible ports for your headset \\u2014 whether that's a 3.5mm jack, USB-C, or something else \\u2014 and Bluetooth support, you should be just fine. Just make sure to check your ports and capabilities before you pick up a headset, because ordering one just to find out later that it isn't compatible is a huge bummer.When it comes to pairing a wireless headset to a console like an Xbox or PlayStation, it's usually as simple as heading into the system's settings menu and pairing your device that way. Sometimes, wireless headsets even come with a USB dongle that you can plug into your console or PC and connect to automatically without the extra layer of setup. Either way, the process is usually quite simple. And of course, if you go the wired route, you should just be able to plug in and play whenever you're ready. To go wireless, or not to go wireless?Wireless headphones have their obvious pros, like convenience and cord management, but the biggest downside to getting any sort of wireless device is the risk of latency issues, or \"lag.\" When you don't have a wire directly connecting your headset to your console, there's a bigger chance that the audio feedback coming from your games won't sync with the signal that your headset is receiving. This can end up being much more than just an annoyance depending on what game you're playing \\u2014 if you're big into titles that require you to think quickly on your feet based on audio queues like horror, rhythm, and battle royale games, it can be seriously detrimental to how effectively you play.If wireless functionality is a priority for you, we recommend getting a headset that also has a wired option, although if you get a more high-end Bluetooth headset, you might not have any latency problems at all. The bottom line: If you're going wireless, don't go cheap.What's the best gaming headset for consoles and PC?We're glad you asked.

Usually, natural ingredients like vinegar, essential oils, and baking soda don't cut through grime or clean well enough to maintain a permanent spot in my cleaning rotation. I've tried nearly every multi-purpose spray, dish soap, and laundry detergent on the eco-friendly market in an effort to cut down on unnecessary chemicals in my home. Still, not all cleaning products are created equally.One of the only exceptions is Dropps laundry detergent. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The easiest low-waste swaps to make your bathroom more eco-friendly\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhy we like Dropps laundry detergentI've been using Dropps laundry detergent for nearly five years, and it's one of the best eco-friendly options on the market. Where other sustainable laundry detergents fall short of cleaning power, Dropps delivers. I've used Dropps to wash countless grease stains out of T-shirts, and it even got red curry out of a white washable rug on one occasion. The pods come in multiple scents (including lavender eucalyptus, orange blossom, and an unscented option) and leave laundry feeling and smelling clean. There's also a sensitive skin option for folks who need gentler ingredients. I've used the stain and odor and sensitive skin formulas and both offered effective cleaning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDropps boxes come attatched together during shipment, then can be separated thanks to the perforated cardboard. \\nCredit: Jae Thomas / Mashable\\n\\n\\nIn terms of ingredients, Dropps is pretty solid and puts sustainability first when sourcing ingredients. Where many traditional detergents contain trace amounts of probable carcinogens, Dropps sticks to products approved by the EPA's Cleangredients database. The only question mark about Dropps has to do with the PVOH pods the soap is held in. There are mixed opinions on whether PVOH is actually fully biodegradable. We took this into account when assigning a sustainability score.A big plus of Dropps on the sustainability front is the packaging and the shipping. Most packages from traditional retailers contain plastic bubble wrap, packing peanuts, and plastic tape that can't be recycled or composted, and just end up in a landfill. Dropps ships all of its products in cardboard boxes made by suppliers that are certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council. The packaging also includes paper tape and fully recyclable shipping labels. If you're a big home composter, you can even compost the cardboard box your laundry soap comes in. Dropps also offers tons of shipping initiatives to help balance carbon emissions \\u2014 read more on that below.I notoriously hate subscriptions and anything on auto-ship, but Dropps is one of the few companies I haven't had a problem with. They regularly send reminder emails before your next shipment is set to be processed (just make sure the emails aren't going to your junk folder). The shipping takes a bit longer than has become normalized (thanks, Amazon), but the sustainability efforts behind the brand make the wait worth it. If you don't want to subscribe, you can also do one-time purchases, but they cost a bit more than the subscriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou'll never have to measure laundry soap again.\\nCredit: Jae Thomas / Mashable\\n\\n\\nI've also had nothing but positive interactions with Dropps customer service. They respond quickly and are invested in keeping customers happy. When I moved states last year, I forgot to change the address on my Dropps subscription. I reached out and they were able to quickly change my address and divert the shipment before it got delivered to my old address. Swap or not?The best way to reduce your waste and live a more sustainable lifestyle is to swap products you use every day for their more sustainable counterparts. We think Dropps is a simple, easy swap to reduce plastic waste from traditional laundry detergent and to wash your clothes with cleaner, gentler ingredients. If you're not ready to go all in on the plastic-free lifestyle, start by swapping your normal laundry detergent for a box of Dropps. Opt for their hand soap tablets or laundry boosters too, if you want to make even more eco-friendly swaps.

The film lit up the box office, beating expectations and grossing $85.4 million worldwide. So it certainly carries a lot of streaming potential. I mean, it's about a bear on a cocaine-fueled killing spree in the Chattahoochee National Forest \\u2014 what's not to like?More specifically, Cocaine Bear follows a group of cops, criminals, tourists, and school-skipping teens crossing paths in the forest after a plane flying over Georgia crashes. The plane happened to be loaded with cocaine and a black bear happened to be the one to come across it. Mashable Entertainment Reporter Belen Edwards called the Cocaine Bear (aka Cokey) \"a cinematic beast,\" although she had mixed feelings on the film in its entirety. If you want to see the bonkers plot unfold for yourself, get your popcorn ready. Here's what you need to know to watch the glorious fever dream that is Cocaine Bear from your couch.\\n\\n\\nIs Cocaine Bear based on a true story?Cocaine Bear is loosely based on a true story. Yes, a bear did cocaine. No, it did not go on a killing spree. In real life, the bear overdosed and died shortly after. In 1985, as the Associated Press reported at the time, investigators were searching the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia for cocaine lost in a smuggling operation. During their search, they found the corpse of a 150-pound black bear with 40 shredded packages of cocaine. Cocaine Bear imagines an alternate scenario where the bear not only lived after ingesting the drugs, but then went on a murderous spree through the forest. It blends horror and comedy seamlessly \\u2014\\xa0after all, it is a bear on cocaine \\u2014\\xa0and weaves some drama and high-octane thrills throughout.Will Cocaine Bear be on Netflix?Though Netflix has a massive catalog, including some based-on-a-true-story films, Universal Pictures has an exclusive deal with Peacock. Thus, that's where Cocaine Bear landed on April 14. Fortunately, Peacock is one of the most affordable streaming services, with plans starting at just $4.99 per month.Can you watch Peacock for free?Peacock is one of the rare streamers that has offered a free tier for viewers since its launch. Though the service has recently done away with the free tier for new customers, it's still available for existing customers. Also, if you subscribe to Peacock Premium for a month, then cancel your subscription, you'll be downgraded back to the free tier. So, although the free tier is no longer available, it's still available. More on that here. Unfortunately, in order to stream Cocaine Bear on Peacock, you'll have to subscribe to the Premium tier (at least for one month). How to watch Cocaine Bear for freeAs of April 14, the only way to legally stream Cocaine Bear is via Peacock Premium. It may appear on other streamers later on down the line, but for now, it's Peacock or bust. There are a few ways you can subscribe to Peacock Premium for free or at least at a discount, so listen up.Are you an Xfinity customer? Good news \\u2014\\xa0Peacock Premium is included for free until June 26, 2023, for all Xfinity Flex customers and Xfinity X1 and video customers who have a subscription to Xfinity Internet or Digital Starter TV.Spectrum TV customers can also score a free year of Peacock Premium, while Spectrum Internet customers can secure 90 days for free. This offer is good through December 7, 2023.It may not be free, but if you opt for an annual subscription rather than a monthly subscription, you can save 67% using the code N2TEWDZZ at checkout. This drops the usual $49.99 subscription fee down to just $19.99. Be sure to check the terms and conditions to make sure you qualify for the discount.Another option, albeit a more annoying one, is to sign up for a Macy's Star Rewards account (don't worry \\u2014\\xa0it's free) with your email, phone number, and birth date. Once you're signed up, turn on email and text notifications to retrieve a unique code and get a year of Peacock Premium for only $19.99 instead of $49.99. More details on that here.Other ways to watch Cocaine BearFor the anti-streaming crowd that doesn't mind paying for a film, Cocaine Bear is set to be released to Blu-ray on April 18, 2023 \\u2014 just a few days after the Peacock release. It's also available to rent or buy on digital platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, and Apple TV. It's $19.99 to rent the movie and $24.99 to buy it and stream it whenever you want.

The last time CO2 levels were as high as today, ocean waters drowned the lands where metropolises like Houston, Miami, and New York City now exist.It\\u2019s a time called the Pliocene or mid-Pliocene, some 3 million years ago, when sea levels were around 30 feet higher (but possibly much more) and giant camels dwelled in a forested high Arctic. The Pliocene was a significantly warmer world, likely at some 5 degrees Fahrenheit (around 3 degrees Celsius) warmer than pre-Industrial temperatures of the late 1800s. Much of the Arctic, which today is largely clad in ice, had melted. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels, a major temperature lever, hovered around 400 parts per million, or ppm. Today, these levels are similar but relentlessly rising, at over 420 ppm.Humanity is currently on track to warm Earth to Pliocene-like temperatures by century\\u2019s end \\u2014 unless nations ambitiously slash carbon emissions in the coming decades. Sea levels, of course, won\\u2019t instantly rise by tens of feet: Miles-thick ice sheets take many centuries to thousands of years to melt. But, critically, humanity is already setting the stage for a relatively quick return to Pliocene climes, or climes at least significantly warmer than now. It\\u2019s happening fast. When CO2 naturally increases in the atmosphere, pockets of ancient air preserved in ice show this CO2 rise happens gradually, over thousands of years. But today, carbon dioxide levels are skyrocketing as humans burn long-buried fossil fuels. \"CO2 in the atmosphere has gone up 100 ppm in my lifetime,\" said Kathleen Benison, a geologist at West Virginia University who researches past climates. \\u201cThat\\u2019s incredibly fast geologically.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The first images of Earth are chilling\\n            \\n\\n\\n\"You don\\u2019t have to be a scientist to realize something totally weird is going on, and that weird thing is humans,\" noted Dan Lunt, a climate scientist at the University of Bristol who has researched the Pliocene.Update April 18, 2023: Since this article was originally published in 2021, atmospheric CO2 levels have continued to rise. Scientists recorded the first reading of CO2 breaching 423 ppm on April 16. Overall, in 2022,  CO2 concentrations averaged out to 417.2 ppm, which is \"more than 50 percent above pre-industrial levels,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA NASA graphic, from 2013, showing Earth's atmospheric CO2 levels had reached levels similar to the Pliocene.\\nCredit: NASA\\n\\n\\nThe problematic PlioceneSure, it takes a long time for sea levels to catch up with Earth\\u2019s warming. But in a plethora of other ways, the planet is already reacting to about 2 F (1.1 C) of warming since the late 1800s: Wildfires are surging in the U.S., major Antarctic ice sheets have destabilized, heat waves are smashing records, storms are intensifying, and beyond. More warming will further exacerbate these consequences of increased heat. It will get worse. But will it get Pliocene bad? That\\u2019s up to the most fickle, unpredictable factor of the climate equation: humans. \"CO2 levels are going to increase,\" said Lunt. \"We could hit the Pliocene in terms of temperature. But it depends on how rapidly we emit [greenhouse gases].\"\\n    \"CO2 levels are going to increase.\"\\n    \\nSome of the human-driven changes happening on Earth today won\\u2019t be reversed for centuries or thousands of years. In large part, that\\u2019s because civilization continues to deposit prodigious loads of carbon into the atmosphere each year, and all these heat-trapping gases won\\u2019t magically vanish from the air, even if we instantly stop adding carbon to the atmosphere. Rather, they\\u2019ll have impacts upon the planet \\u2014 like gradually rising seas and acidifying oceans \\u2014 for at least centuries. Already, sea levels have risen by some eight to nine inches since the late 1800s, and a conservative estimate, from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is sea levels will rise by another one to two feet by the century's end. But, this could very well be more like two or three feet, or even more depending on what Antarctica\\u2019s colossal, melting Thwaites Glacier (it\\u2019s the size of Britain) purges into the sea this century.  \"Sea level rise and ocean acidification are permanent on a human time scale,\" said Julie Brigham-Grette, a geologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who researches how the Arctic has changed since the Pliocene. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkyrocketing atmospheric CO2 levels.\\nCredit: NASA\\n\\n\\nThe Pliocene certainly can\\u2019t give us all the answers for where we\\u2019re headed. We don\\u2019t know, for example, how quickly the seas rose during this far-off period. But the Pliocene does show us how sensitive parts of Earth are to just a few degrees of warming. For instance, much of the vast Greenland ice sheet, which is two and a half times the size of Texas, melted during the warmer Pliocene. And ancient evidence of long-ago beaches, dated to the Pliocene, show where past shorelines lay: A ballpark height of 30 feet or so higher than today is ominous.\"That means the ice sheets are really sensitive to a modest amount of warming,\" said Rob DeConto, a professor of climatology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies the response of ice sheets to a warming climate. This doesn\\u2019t bode well for human civilization, which heavily populates the coastlines. \"That\\u2019s where civilization has built much of its infrastructure,\" said DeConto. \"We\\u2019re a species that gravitated toward the coast.\"Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox?

Humans didn\\u2019t exist (and wouldn\\u2019t exist for millions of years) during the Pliocene \\u2014 though our hirsute primate ancestors were already walking around Africa at the time.So what explains the high Pliocene CO2 levels (400 ppm) without a world of fuel-guzzling cars and coal-fired power plants? The answer lies in deep time. Long before the Pliocene, CO2 levels were extremely elevated during the age of the dinosaurs (which ended 65 million years ago), perhaps at some 2,000 to 4,000 ppm. Tremendous CO2 emissions, from incessant and extreme volcanism, heated Earth and allowed dinosaurs to roam a sultry Antarctic. But over millions of years, Earth\\u2019s natural processes (specifically the slow, grinding, but potent process of rocks absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, dubbed \"the rock thermostat\") gradually reduced CO2 levels to some 400 ppm during the Pliocene. (We know this because there are indirect, though reliable, ways to gauge Earth\\u2019s CO2 levels from millions of years ago, including the chemical make-up of long-dead plankton and the evidence stored in the breathing cells, or stomata, of ancient plants.)\\n    \"We\\u2019re on our way to the Pliocene.\"\\n    \\nAfter the Pliocene, Earth continued to pull CO2 from the air, finally settling CO2 levels between some 200 to 280 ppm during the more recent ice ages, when mammoths, mastodons, and giant sloths dominated a cooler Earth, and humans eventually appeared. But humanity, by rapidly digging up and burning fossil fuels, has now promptly returned CO2 to Pliocene levels.\"We, in 150 years, have completely reversed everything the \\u2018rock thermostat\\u2019 has done in the last 3 million years,\" explained Brigham-Grette. \"The transition from a warm Arctic to a cold one that has ice sheets took a million years. We\\u2019re jumping out of that in less than 150 years.\"\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nIndeed, the Arctic has changed dramatically in just the last 40 years. Arctic sea ice is in rapid decline. Greenland\\u2019s melting is off the charts.Humanity, fortunately, still has the ability to stabilize Earth\\u2019s temperatures this century at levels that would avoid catastrophic impacts like more extreme storms, coral devastation, punishing heat, and beyond. But, as of now, we\\u2019re on a trajectory to the climes of 3 million years ago.

But Netflix's Absurd Planet is an especially good choice for when you're high. It blends absurdist comedy with pretty visuals, the occasional cartoon, and mind-blowing facts. (Fair warning, though, this show can be kind of cringe-inducing if you're not high. Prep accordingly.) \\u2014 A.F.How to watch: Absurd Planet Season 1 is now streaming on Netflix.19. Magic Mike XXLBrushing aside all the intermittent dourness of the first Magic Mike film (Cody Horn who? Exactly!), the middle child of the Magic Mike franchise just wants to be loved. And it goes to extraordinary lengths to achieve that goal.

But it\\u2019s never mean-spirited. Everybody is in on the joke.

Played by familiar faces such as Joey King, Andrew Koji, Bad Bunny, Zazie Beetz, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, and the best in show tag team twins Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry, this movie pops from explosive set piece to explosive set piece.

ManiacPatrick Somerville's limited series is without question the most thematically heavy title on this list. So if you want to keep things on the lighter side, make Maniac your last choice.

Jonah Hill and Emma Stone give astounding performances that are both multidimensional and captivating. \\u2014\\xa0 A.F.How to watch: Maniac is now streaming on Netflix.9. Have A Good Trip: Adventures in PsychedelicsLet's be honest: The best time to hear someone talk about being high is when you are also high. Sting, Sarah Silverman, Nick Offerman, A$AP Rocky, and more share their experiences with psychedelics in this bizarre documentary from Donick Cary. Funny and thoughtful, Have A Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics offers equal parts entertainment and insight. As Sting puts it, \"I don't think psychedelics are the answer to the world's problems.

Galaxy QuestDean Parisot's wildly underrated 1999 goofball comedy about a gang of Trek-adjacent sci-fi has-beens stumbling into a very real intergalactic war, Galaxy Quest is one of the funniest movies of the past 25 years. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Daryl Mitchell star as cynical actors on the convention circuit whose cheesy old show Galaxy Quest gets beamed into the cosmos and mistaken for real by some confused aliens (led by a sweetly deranged Enrico Colantoni and Missi Pyle). Rock monsters and tentacle sex, ahoy. I'm not even a Trek nerd, but by the time the smashing room shows up and Sigourney is threatening the life of an off-screen writer, I'm always \\u2014 every time \\u2014 hyperventilating with laughter. \\u2014 J.A.How to watch: Galaxy Quest is now streaming on Netflix.6.

Scott Pilgrim vs. The WorldLook, we don't put Scott Pilgrim vs. The World on practically every list we curate because we \"want\" to.

A Trip to InfinityIf I\\u2019ve learned anything from watching Richard Linklater movies, it\\u2019s that some people, whilst stoned, like to wax real deep on real big thoughts and jazz. Well, Jonathan Halperin and Drew Takahashi\\u2019s 2022 documentary about the search for the meaning of that really, really, really big number known as infinity (plus one!) is tailor-made to blow such minds. With insights from some of the greatest modern thinkers in mathematics, physics, and philosophy, the film goes even one step further, illustrating their concepts of enormity with trippy animations.

Alternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\\xa0Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.Not the day you're after?

But if what brings you joy is strategy, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.Is Wordle getting harder?It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:Could refer to your best friend, or a pesky paparazzi.Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?Not today!Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...Today's Wordle starts with the letter H.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Wordle-obsessed?

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a twice-occurring letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?No.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?M, P, D, and B.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

All you have to do is tune in.Called \"Calling in Our Corals\", the new citizen science project is a collaboration between Google Arts and Culture and marine biologists across the globe. People are being asked to listen to underwater recordings of coral reefs in Marine Protected Areas through an online platform, identifying sounds made by fish, shrimp, and other marine creatures in order to monitor ecosystems and determine opportunities for reef restoration.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            This giant coral reef is taller than the Empire State Building\\n            \\n\\n\\nScientists have placed hydrophones in 10 reefs across Australia, Indonesia, Philippines, the U.S., Panama, and Sweden, which record 24 hours a day, meaning there's hundreds of hours to sift through. The resulting sounds will be used to \"call life back\" into damaged reefs by hopefully restoring the area's biodiversity. The data will also be used to train an AI model designed to listen to the sounds itself, and enhance understanding and research of coral reefs.\"The audio datasets you will hear have not yet been moderated by the scientists: as you listen, your valuable clicks on the audio will be tracked as timestamps and sent to the researchers so they can understand if there are signs of life in their recordings,\" reads the project website. \"This will be used to monitor ecosystem health, track illegal fishing, and measure success at restoration sites.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Scientists developed low-cost 3D imaging of coral reef health \\u2014 Future Blink\\n            \\n\\n\\nAs well as illegal fishing and habitat destruction, climate change is \"the greatest global threat to coral reef ecosystems,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Warming sea temperatures have caused mass coral bleaching in reefs all over the planet, and the ocean's increased absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has led to widespread ocean acidification, which eats away at coral skeletons.But what you might not know is that despite their underwater locations, coral reefs are actually full of sound, meaning you can tell when one has been potentially impacted \\u2014 those that are quieter are suffering from a lack of marine life. Analyzing the soundscapes of coral reefs can lead to innovative regeneration, which is why Google is calling the project a \"bioacoustic mission.\" So, along with identifying which reefs have been impacted, by identifying the exact creatures making each reef their home, scientists can make calls on how to build those populations and restore the biodiversity of the reef. \"You've got thousands of species of fish that are producing pops and chirps and cranks as they communicate with each other,\" says Steve Simpson, a professor of marine biology at the University of Bristol, in a video on the project's website. \"In the background, you've got the snapping shrimp, each making little popping sounds that together make the reef crackle.\"Each recording on the platform is paired with a spectogram, showing the spectrum of frequencies of the recorded sound waves.

You'll travel throughout the nine realms in search of a way to change the course of the Ragnarok prophecy, encountering various foes along the way who will stop at nothing to keep you from meddling with fate.

Rowling. The Sunday Times quoted Blume as saying, \"I am behind her 100 percent as I watch from afar.\" The story's headline reads, \"The bestselling children\\u2019s writer has shaped the minds of millions, just like the Harry Potter author \\u2014 and she\\u2019s every bit as controversial.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Black, queer and neurodivergent in tech: How one advocate is creating safe space for intersectionality\\n            \\n\\n\\nIn a statement posted to Blume's Twitter account on April 16, Blume said the comment was \"taken out of context\" and that she was merely expressing empathy with those who have been harassed online. \"I wholly support the trans community... I stand with the trans community and vehemently disagree with anyone who does not fully support equality and acceptance for LGBTQIA+ people. Anything to the contrary is total bullshit.\"Blume, known for her best-selling stories about sexuality, puberty, and other topics once seen as \"taboo\" for young children, is back in the press cycle for the newly released adaptation of her book Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.

In February 2022, Freeman profiled The Handmaid's Tale author Margaret Atwood for The Guardian, questioning whether her anti-cancel culture stance was contradicted by her expression of support for the trans community in response to comments from Rowling. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nFreeman issued a response to Blume on Monday, tweeting, \"I don\\u2019t normally respond to nonsense like this because it\\u2019s absurd.

How to see if you're eligible.", "description": "Were you using Facebook sometime between the dates of May 24, 2007 and December 22, 2022?If so, there's a good chance the company, now known as Facebook's parent company Meta, owes you money!And who would turn down free money, right? So, here's what's going on and how you can find out if you're eligible.Over the years, Meta has faced quite a few lawsuits from Facebook users who allege that the company allowed their user data to be accessible to third-parties without users' permission. These lawsuits, which were ultimately consolidated into a class-action lawsuit, Facebook allowed this unauthorized access for users' friends data too. Furthermore, the lawsuits claim that Facebook also did not \"sufficiently monitor\" or enforce its rules on third-parties who had access to user data. One such prominent issue from these lawsuits is in regard to the data Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump's campaign, to access. Facebook privacy settlement payout detailsMeta has now agreed to settle the class action lawsuit. In doing so, the company admits to no wrongdoing. However, as part of the settlement, Meta also agrees to pay out a total of $725 million to affected users. One addendum to add here is that the total also covers various legal and administrative fees, so the sum total of the payout to users will be considerably less. And, of course, the amount users receive will depend on how many people submit an eligible claim.But, hey!

Perhaps you'd like our roundup of the best hookup sites instead.Online dating is kind of the best thing that's ever happened to introverts.Now, you can scan for a potential mate without ever leaving the comfort zone that is your couch. Of course, even with virtual dating, you'll eventually need to get up and go on a date. But hey, it's better than trying to find a single cutie in the dive bar crowd or approaching a random person in a coffee shop looking like the \"two fingers touching\" meme guy.As most introverts know, getting your energy from alone time doesn't necessarily mean that you're shy.

Tinder, for instance, seems to be the go-to for anyone dabbling with online dating, but it's not automatically an easy place to socialize just because it's behind a screen.

How do I explore my identity?", "description": "\"It was probably BDSM,\" my friend Laura* smirks. We\\u2019re at a school reunion, standing outside a bar in my hometown smoking a cigarette. Passing it back and forth in that intimate way we used to. I don\\u2019t smoke anymore, but the occasion seems to invite it.\\xa0She was my best friend, in that all-consuming way that teenage girls can be. Now we\\u2019re looking back at what we used to do with each other \\u2014 perhaps we were in a relationship, we just didn\\u2019t know we could be, no words to define how we felt.During my twenties, I slipped on the uniform of heterosexuality easily. Hungrily kissing men on sticky dance floors and taking them back to mine for one-night stands. When I\\u2019d snog Laura, put my fingers in her knickers and run my hands over her arse, I thought I was performing for the men watching from the dark corners of the dingy nightclub we went to every weekend. I wanted to turn them on.But there were no prying eyes when we got home. I\\u2019d tell her what to do and she\\u2019d comply with a submissive giggle. A kinky sort of power play. I now know \\u2014 when we touched, kissed, explored \\u2014 that it was sex. My '90s education meant I thought it was only sex when it was penis-in-vagina sex. I remember being given a book about \"where babies come from.\" I didn\\u2019t understand the nuances of women\\u2019s sexuality. I wish I\\u2019d known then what I know now.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best dating apps for bisexual people: Where to meet people who get it\\n            \\n\\n\\nI love looking at women. I fancy women. I want to acknowledge Laura as one of the first great loves of my life, more than just an old schoolmate. But what can I do now that it\\u2019s 20 years later and I\\u2019m in a monogamous marriage with a man, outwardly heterosexual to those who look in? I decided to set on a journey \\u2014 meeting experts and others on sexual re-awakenings along the way \\u2014 to find out.Am I bisexual?\\xa0I started my quest as so many have before \\u2014 online. Furiously typing questions like, \"can I be bisexual if I\\u2019m married to a man?\" \"What even is bisexuality?\" \"I\\u2019m married to a man but I fancy women too, is this okay?\" I briefly wonder how it might have been different for my 16-year-old self as I discover other sexually curious women hiding in corners on Reddit, Twitter, Instagram. There\\u2019s communities of women just like me.\\xa0Women like 39-year-old Cassie Brooks, too. She's been happily married to a man for 15 years. When we start chatting, it feels like an outpouring. \"I think about women often and have deep friendships and connections with the women in my life,\" she confesses. But Cassie grew up in a deeply religious family, although she\\u2019s since walked away from her Christian faith.\\xa0Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.Her realisation \\u2014 a sort of epiphany \\u2014\\xa0 came when she was in a swimming pool with one of her mates. \"She wrapped her arms around me from behind. It elicited warm, fuzzy feelings inside me,\" Cassie tells me. \"It felt charged, magnetic. I turned in her arms and asked, \\u2018do you feel this?\\u2019 She nodded and giggled and splashed me with water.\" Cassie struggled with these feelings because she loves her husband. It felt like she was \"cheating,\" even though they hadn\\u2019t kissed.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            I'm a bisexual woman and I don't know how to date men\\n            \\n\\n\\nThis sexual fluidity \\u2014\\xa0 identifying as straight, then fancying someone of the same gender \\u2014 has also shown up in research, too. When I contact sociologist and psychosexual psychotherapist Jordan Dixon to help me unravel how I am feeling she points me towards a study by psychologist Lisa Diamond. \\u2018Female bisexuality from adolescence to adulthood\\u2019 was conducted on 79 women over the course of ten years. Two-thirds of the women changed the identity labels they\\u2019d claimed at the beginning, with a third changing multiple times. By the end, more women identified as bisexual or chose to have no label at all, rather than say they were straight.\\xa0Another study found that women are often influenced by romantic opportunities rather than being rigid in their attractions. \"Women\\u2019s sexuality may be more flexible and adaptive than men\\u2019s,\" commented the study\\u2019s author Elizabeth Aura McClintock, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Notre Dame. \"Having flexible sexual attractions may grant greater importance to contextual and experiential factors when it comes to sexual identity.\" These findings were also reflected in the 2020 census in the UK, more women than men said they were bisexual\\xa0 \\u2013 1.6 percent of women compared to 0.9 percent of men.Embracing the bi side of me\"I\\u2019m not straight, I just love dick,\" when the character Arabella (Michaela Coel) uttered those words in BBC drama I May Destroy You, I\\u2019d never felt so understood. I roll them over in my mind as I fill in the application to Skirt Club \\u2014 a private network for straight and bisexual women who are sexually curious. When the form asks about my sexuality, I tick the box that says: mostly straight but more than incidentally homosexual. I don\\u2019t even know if that fits how I feel.Skirt Club was founded by Genevieve LeJeune in 2014, mostly because she was looking for other women like her. \"Bisexuality is this grey area,\" she tells me over Zoom, \"a huge taboo attached to it. When I started using the label bisexual, people kept asking me the same questions: what's wrong? Why can\\u2019t you choose?\"\\n    \"When I started using the label bisexual, people kept asking me the same questions: what's wrong? Why can\\u2019t you choose?\"\\n    \\nI tell LeJeune how I\\u2019ve been feeling. I\\u2019m compelled to reveal my past with Laura and that I\\u2019m with a man but I think about women. That I\\u2019ve never really said out loud that I think I\\u2019m bisexual. She invites me to one of Skirt Club\\u2019s signature parties at a secret location in London. \"Women act differently without men,\" LeJeune says.\\xa0And I can see that as soon as I step into this new world, wearing a silk dress and knee high boots. One of the hostesses attaches a key to my wrist. It shows that I\\u2019m new (usually around 70 percent of those attending are there for the first time) and unlocks the start of a journey.\\xa0I sip on a glass of bubbles and settle in a corner to observe. A woman in a tight red dress gives me the eye. She also has a key dangling down her hand. Her fingertips graze my thigh. She\\u2019ll never date a man again, she tells me with vitriol. She\\u2019s clearly experienced too much hurt.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Going to your first sex party? Here's a beginner's guide.\\n            \\n\\n\\nAfter an orientation speech stating the importance of consent, the bar area clears quickly and I wonder where everyone\\u2019s gone. I head upstairs to the bedrooms. There\\u2019s a smell of sex \\u2014 sweet and sensuous \\u2014 and a mass of writhing naked women that looks like some kind of Pre-Raphaelite painting come to life, reimagined in 2023 for a female gaze.\\xa0Most of the women hadn't met until that moment. I think about all those myths that are rammed into us, that women need an emotional connection to climax. Maybe what they actually needed was to be in a room full of other women. I didn\\u2019t join in. I didn\\u2019t have to, to enjoy it. Just being there was enough. I felt seen, understood.A coming out, of sortsI realised how much I\\u2019ve internalised myths and stereotypes, inhaled them as facts that I need to let go. That key from Skirt Club has unlocked something. My friend tells me about a book that blew her mind and urges me to read it.\\xa0Untrue by writer and social researcher Wednesday Martin unravels why nearly everything we believe about women and lust is false. In a chapter called \"Women Who Love Sex Too Much,\" Martin introduces us to Dr. Meredith Chivers who did a study on women\\u2019s and men\\u2019s reactions to porn. Predictably, self-identifying straight men had the strongest reaction to guy-on-girl action. In contrast, women \\u2014 even those who said they were straight \\u2014 had physical responses to everything: a woman having sex with a woman, man-on-man action, and even bonobos getting down to it.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How problematic is bi pornography?\\n            \\n\\n\\nMostly, what I\\u2019ve discovered is that sexual identity is complex. \"Some women may be attracted to other women, but they may not wish to act upon it,\" says Dixon, who implores anyone reading this to ask themselves: What would labelling mean to you? What do you want? Why? What would it mean for your partner to bear witness to that? \"For those in hetero relationships, whether we decide to tell our partners or not, it can help to know that this doesn\\u2019t mean our decision is always fixed,\" she assures.\\xa0\\n    Having experience doesn't define sexuality.\\n    \\nAccording to research by Pew Research Center in the U.S., only 19 percent of bisexuals are \"out.\" And although I\\u2019m writing this, I don\\u2019t think I feel the need to explicitly \"come out\" to anyone. According to therapist Chris Sheridan, the act of coming out can actually be disempowering to some. \"It implies there's a secret or it's owed to heteronormative society,\" Sheridan explains. Instead, do it on your terms. \"Some people choose not to come out, others opt for coming out to some people and not others. It\\u2019s up to you.\"For Cassie, this looks like telling her husband how she feels. \"To my relief, he said 'I know.' He asked me if I still loved him and I said yes.\" Their marriage is monogamous but Cassie knowing this about herself is enough for now \\u2014 having experience doesn't define sexuality. \"I 100 percent consider myself bisexual,\" she says. \"It took me a little while to associate that as part of my identity because I didn\\u2019t have experience. But the definition is attraction to both genders \\u2014 I definitely fit that.\"As for me, I\\u2019m holding on to the advice from the therapists I spoke to: \"Give yourself permission to fully fantasise about different genders during solo sex,\" Sherdian told me. And \"personal intimacy with ourselves means creating a private zone,\" says Dixon, \"it\\u2019s a space \\u2013 physical, emotional, intellectual \\u2013 that belongs only to us and we can play with whoever we like in our minds. Everyone can cultivate a secret erotic fantasy garden to play in.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How problematic is bi pornography?\\n            \\n\\n\\nAnd what I witnessed at Skirt Club, just conjuring it in my mind makes me wet. So does lesbian porn. So does having sex with my husband. So, too, does a plethora of other things. Holding this knowledge about my shapeshifting sexuality feels powerful. I can't be all parts of myself to everyone at all times. And those fragments of myself are also constantly in flux. This is a moment in time and right now I\\u2019m bisexual \\u2014 regardless of my relationship status. I can\\u2019t wait to see what comes next\\u2026 but I doubt I will ever say I\\u2019m straight again.\\xa0*name has been changed", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/bisexual-woman-monogamous-relationship-with-man", "pubDate": "Mon, 17 Apr 2023 14:45:39 +0000"}, {"title": "Save $40 on Amazon's newest Echo Buds", "description": "SAVE $40: As of April 17, you can grab a pair of Amazon Echo Buds for $79.99, down from $119.99 (discount is automatically applied at checkout).

Armed with only a small knife, Lottie doesn't take a gun on her mission as Natalie does, due to her loyal follower Mari (Alexa Barajas) putting faith in Lottie's apparent spiritual connection with the woods.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2, episode 3 recap: Why Lottie's bee lesson is so important\\n            \\n\\n\\nDuring the hunt, Lottie experiences one of her more intense, immersive visions. Frustrated that her own alignment with the wilderness bears no, uh, bear, Lottie soldiers on and stumbles across the group's \"Doomcoming\" tree stump altar, where she sacrificed the bear heart at the close of Season 1. Cutting her palm with the knife, Lottie bleeds on the altar \\u2014 and she loses a lot of blood. Like, a bunch. Whether she's hallucinating from blood loss or whether she's being guided by a supernatural presence, Lottie loses consciousness and descends into the vision in question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nBut what does it all mean? Let's piece it together.What happens in Lottie's vision?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLaura Lee's plane is Lottie's first stop.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nWandering through the snowy woods in her subconscious, Lottie comes across the plane Laura Lee (Jane Widdop) was piloting when it exploded in mid-air, killing her in Season 1, episode 8 (\"Flight of the Bumblebee\"). Within the aircraft, Lottie finds Laura Lee's teddy bear, Leonard, which had caught alight in the passenger seat, along with Laura Lee's cross necklace lying on a hatch. Opening it, Lottie climbs into a space that resembles the abandoned tunnels Lottie traversed during her baptism vision in Season 1 (remember, the one with all the candles in it). But instead, Lottie finds herself transported through an elevator into a shopping mall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is...new.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nA slower, somehow more haunting version of Craig Wedren and Anna Waronker's Yellowjackets theme song \"No Return\" plays as Lottie wanders among the crowds. A cheery fashion store sales person asks if she'd like to try something on. Then, Lottie hears familiar laughter and finds Taissa, Van, Mari, Akilah, Natalie, Shauna, Misty, and Laura Lee sitting at a table outside a mall restaurant. Chatting happily in this dream food court instead of arguing in their real-life cabin, they've all had glow-ups; they're wearing shiny accessories and makeup and have brushed hair. Sipping idly from soda cups and eating from takeout boxes (instead of feasting on their fallen teammates), they're back to their old Wiskayok High School selves.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLaura Lee offers her a meal, but Lottie unfortunately seems too weak to lift even a forkful to her mouth, while her teammates look at her quizzically. However, it's not her strength that's the problem. \"Don't you think you should say something first?\" asks Laura Lee, as the Yellowjackets look on expectantly. \"Uh, I didn't think that I'd have to,\" replies Lottie, now shivering.\"I think I saw a coat for sale at Abercrombie,\" says Van. \"I don't think I have a credit card,\" stammers Lottie.The girls all laugh at her, looking incredulously at each other. \"When did that ever stop you?\" says Natalie.\"I think we need to get you out of here,\" says Laura Lee, as Lottie begins to shake from the cold. \"Lottie, if you don't get warm, you're going to die.\" Laura Lee then shoves Lottie backwards in her chair, and she returns to consciousness.Bottom line: Lottie's cold and hungry. But what's the rest of it all about?Lottie's under a lot of pressure as spiritual leaderHeavy is the head that wears the antler crown. Bestowing herself with said headpiece during Season 1's ninth episode, \"Doomcoming,\" Lottie may have leaned into the act of ritual a little intensely (never forget, Travis). But going from teen soccer star to spiritual leader isn't an overnight process, especially when your newly minted followers start demanding miracles \\u2014 including the weaponless hunting mission Lottie currently finds herself on.When she fails to find anything without proper gear or tracking experience (you don't say), Lottie comes across one of those weird symbols carved into a tree. Giving it a red hot \"might as well\" go, she holds her hand to the symbol and tries to commune with the wilderness. \"Fuck me,\" she says, when it doesn't work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe batteries mustn't be charged.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLottie's road to Antler Queen hasn't exactly been a given in Yellowjackets. Early in Season 1, Lottie isn't even spiritual. Rites and rituals are not regular things in Lottie's life before her increasingly prominent visions began to define her experience in the wilderness \\u2014 she's even reluctant to join hands with her fellow teammates in silence for the people who died in the plane crash. (Remember, her parents sent her to a psychiatrist as a child after her sudden scream saved them from a car accident; the prescription medication she'd been taking eventually ran out, leaving the question of where her visions come from open ended.)In the mall vision, we suddenly see the intense pressure weighing on her, as she's increasingly expected by certain members of the team to provide magical solutions to their supply problems. Lottie's exhaustion at taking on the role of spiritual leader seems clear in this scene; she appears weary at the very idea of saying grace before eating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie's got a lot on her plate.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nIn her vision, it's clear that Lottie doesn't dream of spiritual dominance; instead she craves a level of teen normality, her carefree adolescence returning for a moment. No longer is she an Antler Queen, high priestess of the wilderness and all the ritual sacrifice that apparently goes with it; she's browsing fashion and hanging out in a food court with her friends. However, Lottie feels exposed and ridiculed in this scene, which may mirror her subconscious fears about her role as spiritual provider.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch the 'Yellowjackets' cast absolutely crush Mash Libs\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie's vision reveals a deep insecurity (and a throwback to Season 1)What's up with that strange remark from Natalie, after Lottie panics that she wouldn't be able to pay for an Abercrombie coat mentioned by Van? \"When did that ever stop you?\" Natalie teases her. Not only is this moment reminiscent of dreams we've all had where we just can't seem to get the thing we want (in this case, Lottie needs warmth), it's actually a throwback to Season 1.Natalie's comment is a reference to the very first night the Yellowjackets spend in the woods after the plane crash, when the team members offer up their deepest secrets as they're gathered around the fire. Some are sillier than others, but Lottie's secret involves her shoplifting clothing from T.J. Maxx, then returning it for store credit, which means she's clocked \"thousands of dollars in T.J. Bucks.\" Perhaps Lottie feels guilty for this now? It's not the only thing she feels guilty about...Laura Lee's presence dominates Lottie's vision\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCuriouser and curiousers.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nIn her mall vision, Lottie appears to have taken on Laura Lee as her inner voice of reason, which we know has repercussions in the future, when adult Lottie sees a vision of her after Travis's death in the barn. That vision, however, will not be so nice and caring; that Laura Lee is a rotting corpse that terrifies Lottie with a scream. The barn scene may also be indicative of Lottie's deep guilt over Laura Lee's death, backed up by what Lottie says to her in the mall vision: \"I don't want to leave you.\" Seeing as though this vision kicks off when Lottie envisions coming across Laura Lee's plane, and Laura Lee is the main Yellowjacket who speaks during this vision, Lottie has clearly not processed the death of her friend \\u2014 whose tragic end she also foresaw.Laura Lee's costuming and position at the head of the table have significance as well. As spotted on Twitter, Laura Lee wears a black headband on her blonde hair, in a haircut aesthetic that resembles that of Disney's adaptation of Lewis Carroll's famous journey into the subconscious, Alice in Wonderland. In this vision, Yellowjackets has created its own Mad Hatter's tea party in Lottie's mind.Lottie's visions have emerged in the present\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQueen of Hearts, eh?\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLottie's immersive visions, like the mall sequence, seem to have followed her out of the wilderness into the present. Though adult Lottie (Simone Kessell) tells her psychiatrist she hasn't had visions \"in decades,\" she sees multiple disturbing images in a short period of time: bloody beehives and Queen of Hearts cards with their eyes scratched out, all pretty grim stuff. Notably, Lottie disputes the visions in her session, defiant that her visions aren't trying to tell her anything: \"Because they're not real.\"That being said, Lottie later takes a giant ceremonial dagger through her cult wellness compound to a nondescript tree stump off the main path, where she cuts her hand just as she did in the wilderness. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to old habits.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\n\"Can this just be enough, please?\" Lottie pleads aloud. Did\\u2026Lottie bring the tree altar back with her from the wild, and with it the darkness? Is she...still sacrificing blood to it somehow?\"The last time it became something different,\" Lottie says, looking frankly terrified.\\xa0\"Can't happen again.\"It seems the mall vision won't be the last of Lottie's visions.

We get a glimpse into the team's 1998 return in the second season's first episode, as we see the girls herded past one hungry press horde. Since their return, Lottie hasn't uttered a word. She spends her nights silently wandering around her parents' home, so they have her committed to a psychiatric facility. During a session of electroconvulsive therapy, Lottie experiences flashbacks to her visions from the wilderness, and later in her hospital room she uses her \"healing hand\" breathing technique to calm her roommate's anxiety attack, like she did multiple times with Travis in the woods. It seems Lottie may have been inspired by her own confidence in her healing abilities to open a dedicated facility...in the woods.What's the nature of Lottie's wellness retreat?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self.\"\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLottie appears to be running a pretty standard holistic mental health retreat at Camp Green Pine, located in some rural area off Route 19. Lottie calmly explains to a cynical Natalie in episode 2, \"We are not a cult. We are an intentional community turning suffering into strength so we can live as our best selves.\" The compound appeals to people seeking therapy for trauma or to process negative emotions \\u2014 for one, Lottie's assistant Lisa (Nicole Maines) is working with her depression.\"There's only one person who can really give you what you're looking for: You. Your truest, most authentic self. That's why you're here, so I can introduce you,\" Lottie says in her welcome speech in episode 2. \"Right now there is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self. And there is nothing more painful than hiding that self.\"\\n    \"We are not a cult. We are an intentional community turning suffering into strength so we can live as our best selves.\"\\n            - Lottie, 'Yellowjackets'\\n\\nChickens roam freely among the camp's curated grounds, residents sit in quiet conversation around the communal bonfire when they're not in their fancy cabins, and late at night, they engage in ritualistic faux burials wearing animal masks and white robes \\u2014 or sometimes nothing at all. \"A therapeutic treatment, one of many we offer here,\" Lottie explains. Who knows if there's a quiz night? Though Lottie sets some 'guidelines' in her welcome speeches, Lisa explains to Natalie in episode 4, \"There are no rules at the compound,\" Residents are technically allowed to leave the compound whenever they want, but are required to help run things there, leading workshops and tending gardens. But Natalie finds it weird there's even a 'rule' for this, \"Almost like she wants to give you the illusion of freedom so that you'll always come back.\"\\xa0The only time followers leave the compound, is to head to the farmer's market using Lottie's car, and Lisa tells Natalie in episode 4 that Lottie's follower Todd never lets her make any stops aside from the market or the bank \\u2014 and she asks Natalie not to tell Lottie she's visited her mother's house. \"It's not that we're not allowed, it's that Charlotte doesn't think it's a good idea. She says our anchors are at the compound, not out here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBees! Wait what's that symbol on the hive...\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nBut it's not all Goopy woo-woo wellness vibes all the time, as Lottie momentarily loses her chill over something so small as a health shake ingredient in episode 2 (heath shakes are big at the compound). When her associate Lisa brings her daily shake, she quietly reprimands her. \"I smell butterscotch, did you put maca root in here? Hmm. I asked for ashwagandha. I want my focus increased, not my libido.\" Lottie then promptly throws her shake, in a reusable cup with reusable straw, in the garbage \\u2014 not exactly a sustainable practice.Lottie also keeps bees and her followers sell their \"Sunshine Honey\" at the local farmer's market, generating income for the retreat. But perhaps there's something more sinister afoot, as those bees buzz around in hives emblazoned with a little thing Lottie's brought back from the woods: that dreaded symbol.Why do Lottie's followers wear purple?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are not a cult.\" \\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nIt's the cultiest vibe of Lottie's compound, the fact that everyone wears the same shade of purple. When we first meet Lottie as an adult, she's giving a motivational talk from a minimalist wooden stage. She's orating to an audience completely dressed in purple clothing, while she's dressed in bright orange. I'm just saying, it's the same hue as the followers of Rajneeshpuram, the commune established in rural Oregon in the 1980s that formed the focus of Netflix's Wild Wild Country. Do with that what you will.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie's gone back into the woods, sort of.\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nSo, why purple? First things first. \"It\\u2019s heliotrope, it\\u2019s not purple,\" Lottie insists. \"We make the dye ourselves from the flowers used to treat wounds.\" But Lisa gives a little more context to Natalie in episode 4: \"Some people at the compound come from a lot of money, others don't. Charlotte wanted everyone to be equal there.\"Is there a connection between the wilderness and Lottie's cult?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That thing around your neck tells me all I need to know.\"\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nThe seemingly apotropaic icon we've seen all series immediately comes into play in episode 1, when Natalie notices it being worn as a pendant by Lisa: \"That thing around your neck tells me all I need to know.\" In the past, Lottie sees the symbol as protection, which is why she adds it to the baby blanket gift for Shauna in episode 3, so perhaps it's continued to have that significance for her.But it's not the only thing Lottie may have brought back with her. In episode 3, Natalie sees a pair of antlers mounted on a shield outside Lottie's compound quarters suggesting she hasn't entirely shaken off her Antler Queen past, and in episode 4, it appears she may have something resembling the tree altar from the \"Doomscoming\" episode on the compound grounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie's quarters have one notable decoration... \\U0001f98c\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nAnd then, there's Lottie's visions, which seem to have followed her out of the wilderness into the present. Lottie tells her psychiatrist in episode 4 she hasn't had visions \"in decades,\" but has recently she seen multiple disturbing images in a short period of time: first, it's Laura Lee appearing to her after Travis' death. Then, it's bloody beehives and hearing one of her followers say \"il veut du sang\" \\u2014 in French, \"It wants blood,\" \\u2014 which is what Lottie says in her first unexplained episode during the attic seance. Then, among her followers' gratitude notes, she sees a Queen of Hearts cards with their eyes scratched out. Notably, Lottie is defiant that her visions aren't trying to tell her anything: \"Because they're not real.\"Lottie later takes a giant ceremonial dagger through the compound, past followers quietly speaking and huddled around the fire, to a nondescript tree stump off the main path, where she cuts her hand just as she did in the wilderness. \"Can this just be enough, please?\" Lottie pleads aloud. Wh--what?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, \"We are not a cult.\"\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nHow did Lottie's cult begin in the wilderness?Lottie's journey toward becoming the Yellowjackets' spiritual leader in the wilderness runs a steady pace over the seasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have a bad feeling about this place.\"\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nThough Lottie's initial connection to spirituality seems loose in Season 1, her increasingly prominent \"visions\" define her experience in the wilderness, from her French-speaking outburst during the attic seance to Jackie finding her standing in the lake in her PJs, not to mention her underwater premonition of Laura Lee's explosive death. Lottie is the first Yellowjacket to find one of the series' signature spooky symbols carved into a tree, and she dons a crown of antlers in the \"Doomcoming\" episode, all but confirming she's the Antler Queen from the Season 1's opening scene of ritualistic cannibalism.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nTripping on Misty's mushrooms, Lottie easily leads several fellow Yellowjackets into a bacchanal of screaming, howling girls who pursue Travis for their own hedonistic, violent, and possibly sacrificial means. During their psychedelic journey, Lottie says aloud, \"We won't be hungry much longer.\" The next day, she confronts a bear that wanders near their cabin and seemingly kneels before her so she can kill it. This moment seems to solidify her divine association to several followers, including Van and Misty, who join her for a ritualistic offering of the bear's heart to an altar. \"Shed blood, my beautiful friends, and let the darkness set us free,\" Lottie declares. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeva4get.\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nDuring their time in the woods, Lottie constantly talks about this darkness in the wilderness \"being in all of you.\" During the seance scene, she repeats the words, \"It wants\\u2026It wants\\u2026It wants\\u2026hungry,\" before speaking in French about something wanting blood and declaring, \"You must spill blood or else.\" This is exactly what Lottie hears one of her followers say in the present in Season 2, episode 4 during her bloody beehive vision.By Season 2, Lottie's slowly gaining a foothold as the team's spiritual leader, building from her bloody tea blessings and meditation sessions to more dramatic, ominous happenings, like in episode 4, when a bunch of birds slam into the cabin after Shauna nosebleeds on the baby blanket Lottie gifted her...emblazoned with that strange symbol. Lottie's fiercely loyal follower, Mari, keeps championing her gifts, drawing in Van, Misty, and Akilah to the cause. And then, there's Lottie's hypothermia-induced mall vision in episode 4, which shows she's under extreme pressure to be the group's spiritual leader.Lottie's gift of foresight has a longer history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLottie's experiences with visions run deeper than her time in the wilderness. In Season 1, the series takes us back into Lottie's childhood, when she screams in terror from the back seat of her parents' car right before a crash occurs \\u2014 one that would have most certainly involved their car had she not screamed, causing her dad to brake. Dismissing the possibility of Lottie's clairvoyance, her parents decide to send her to a psychiatrist, where she's prescribed an ambiguous medication for her mental health. In the wilderness, Lottie takes her last remaining pill, and the visions begin.Why did Lottie's group kidnap Natalie?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a gentle introduction.\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nEssentially, Lottie's community members kidnapped Natalie to save her life. But they didn't save her...gently. In the first season's finale, a group of purple-clad people burst into Natalie's hotel room just as she's about to kill herself, dragging her into a van marked with the symbol from the wilderness. In Season 2's first episode, Natalie is being held captive in a wooden cabin, where she's restrained by the wrists. Why does Lottie have bed cuffs installed in her accommodation? \"We were afraid you were going to hurt yourself,\" says Lisa, who has been assigned to supervise Natalie. It appears to be the type of physical restraint used in psychiatric facilities, and as Natalie realises, it's not a regular practice residents like Lisa are used to at all. In episode 4, Lisa is obviously hurt that Natalie doesn't appreciate what she and the residents did, angrily shouting, \"We saved your life!\" during a confrontation.But Camp Green Pine's real \"Hotel California\" energy was pretty freaky when Natalie violently escaped her cabin cell, as followers in purple pursued her through the woodsy darkness, calling out, \"Hey, get back here!\" Not exactly welcoming, huh?Why did Lottie take Travis's money?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourtney Eaton as Lottie and Kevin Alves as Travis.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nAmid Natalie (Juliette Lewis) and Misty's (Christina Ricci) investigations into the suspicious death of Travis (Andres Soto), we find out Lottie was the one responsible for draining his bank account after he died. How is Lottie connected to Travis's death, and did she tell Natalie the truth? What's her plan with all of his cash? Considering Lottie's establishment is well up and running, it seems unlikely she used the money to fund her retreat \\u2014 but Natalie is valiantly trying to get into her private quarters to find more information.What was Travis and Lottie's relationship like after they left the wilderness though? Beyond that whole almost-sacrificial moment (whoops!), Travis seems to have found a spiritual connection with Lottie during her anxiety-quelling breathing practices, and Lottie flashes into Travis' mind during sex with Natalie. Plus, Lottie has been insistent that Javi, his missing brother, is alive in the woods, despite Nat's criticism of this \"false hope\" \\u2014 and then, suddenly he turns up alive in episode 4.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie says Travis gave her instructions to access his bank accounts.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nWhen grown-up Natalie confronts Lottie in episode 1, she's pretty damn pissed, though Lottie claims to have a message for her from Travis. In episode 2, this turns out to be the note Travis wrote and left in his house, reading \"Tell Nat she was right.\" Lottie tells Nat the story of Travis' death as accidental in his quest to somehow communicate with the darkness from the wilderness. Driving to his house after a worrying call, Lottie finds Travis panicking, saying, \"When Van almost died, when you did, you both said you saw something. The only way to confront the darkness to find out what it wants is to get as close to death as possible.\" Lottie soothes Travis, they both fall asleep, and in the night Travis drives to the ranch where he works, apparently leaving Lottie instructions of how to get into his bank account. Lottie somehow guesses he's gone to the ranch, finds him in the barn, and says, \"He had lit candles around him in the shape of the symbol.\" She helps Travis in his dangerous quest, but it goes wrong and he dies by suicide. Lottie leaves one part of out of her story: she sees Laura Lee's ghost in the barn.\"I didn't kill him, Nat. I was trying to save him,\" Lottie says. So, is Lottie telling the truth about what happened to Travis? Did she really try to help him? Was it an accident? Why didn't Lottie try other ways to save Travis? Does it have anything to do with Camp Green Pine? As Natalie says, \"I know there's something you're not telling me.\"There's plenty more ahead \\u2014 we'll keep you updated every week on all things Lottie.

According to a new report by The New York Times, the company is working on a new, AI-enhanced search engine codenamed Magi. This new search experience will reportedly offer a \"far more personalized experience\" than what you currently get on Google Search, and it will attempt to \"anticipate users' needs.\" While the report claims the project is still in an early stage, possible features include a conversational approach to search (think talking to ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot which kicked off the recent AI race), with the engine learning from users' previous searches to offer better results in the future. In practice, the service might offer the user a preselected list of things they might want to buy, and topics they might want to research.

Google launched its own AI chatbot, Bard, in March, to a limited number of users, but hasn't yet integrated it with Google Search.

Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.The shows in question are Barry and Succession, and their \"Desperado\" references aired within weeks of each other. Succession's came first, with the release of \"Rehearsal,\" the second episode of Season 4. The episode sees Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) wallowing in misery before his wedding. He persuades his siblings Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook), and Roman (Kieran Culkin) to go to karaoke with him, where he asks the fateful question, \"Think they have 'Desperado' by the Eagles?\"\"I would imagine they do,\" Roman says, before adding, \"longest night of my life.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Have 'Succession' and 'The Last of Us' started the next big TV trend?\\n            \\n\\n\\nLuckily for Roman, Connor does not perform the Eagles' hit about a lonely \"desperado\" figure who is afraid to settle and find love. Instead, he opts to sing Leonard Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" which ends up being much worse for Roman. (\"Guantanamo-level shit,\" he calls it.)\"Desperado\" only gets a quick mention in Succession, but it's a perfect character moment for Connor. Of course he would try to sing a deeply sad, soft rock song at a karaoke bar \\u2014 one of the absolute worst choices you could make at karaoke. The gag fully encapsulates his self-indulgent melancholy, while his siblings' reactions to the proposed song capture their own discomfort and exasperation with the entire scenario.HBO's \"Desperado\" shenanigans continue two weeks after the original airdate of \"Rehearsal,\" with Barry's \"bestest place on the earth.\" (Also episode 2 of Season 4.) Turns out that Succession's \"Desperado\" name drop was just a teaser for the \"Desperado\"-related ridiculousness Barry unleashes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDesperad-oh no.\\nCredit: Merrick Morton/HBO\\n\\n\\nSaid ridiculousness revolves around acting teacher Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler). After helping turn Barry Berkman (Bill Hader) in for the murder of Janice Moss (Paula Newsome) at the end of Season 3, Gene promises Janice's father Jim (Robert Wisdom) that he won't speak to the press. Neither wants to turn her death into a media circus.However, Gene can't resist the call of publicity for his heroism, so he devises a way to tell his story anyway. He brings Vanity Fair writer Lon O'Neil (Patrick Fischler) to his old theater, where he performs an absolutely cringe-worthy one man show about his time with Barry. The song that plays when Lon first enters the theater? \"Desperado.\"But not just any version of \"Desperado\" \\u2014 Gene chooses the Langley School Music Project's cover of the song. A simple piano accompanies a lone child's voice, creating a haunting, earnest effect. That effect immediately reaches peak hilarity when juxtaposed with Gene's show.  It's already such a self-serving, egotistical act, but the addition of this cover of \"Desperado\" nudges Gene's performance right into the sweet spot where it's so overly serious and dramatic that it loops back around to comedic brilliance. Hader, who directed the entirety of Season 4, chose the song while planning out the season in July 2022.Two nods to the song in two of HBO's highest-profile shows within two weeks of each other is one mighty strange coincidence. Even stranger? \"Desperado\" also links back to HBO's biggest show of the year so far: The Last of Us.The much-raved about third episode of The Last of Us is titled \"Long, Long Time,\" after the Linda Ronstadt song of the same name that plays a key role in the love story between Bill (Nick Offerman) and Frank (Murray Bartlett). Ronstadt recorded a cover of \"Desperado,\" but the connections don't stop there! The original members of the Eagles first met while playing backup for Ronstadt.I know there's likely no ploy from HBO to engineer a \"Desperado\" renaissance, but consider: The Last of Us airs first, making us think about Linda Ronstadt. (And perhaps...her backing band?) Then, Succession mentions \"Desperado.\" Not long after, we finally get a version of the song in Barry! Has all of HBO's 2023 programming been leading up to this moment? Will \"Desperado\" pop up in True Detective: Night Country or House of the Dragon Season 2? Or am I just sitting alone in front of my \"Desperado\"-HBO yarn wall, grasping at straws? You and I both know it's the last one, but as far as niche TV trends go, this has to be one of my favorites.Succession is now streaming on HBO Max, with new episodes airing at 9 p.m. ET Sundays on HBO and HBO Max.Barry is now streaming on HBO Max, with new episodes airing at 10 p.m. ET Sundays on HBO and HBO Max.

These are great if you genuinely need to re-furnish, but they don't tackle the reason why bathrooms are inherently one of the least-sustainable rooms in the house: disposable products.You know how quickly that bathroom trash can fills up. Between toothbrushes, Q-tips, razors, and more, our morning and nighttime routines are built around items that are used for a few seconds, thrown away, and left to wreak havoc in landfills for literal centuries or join the 8 million metric tons of plastic dumped into the ocean every year.We can't bank on recyclingMost relatively-aware people will remember to recycle a cardboard box or soup can. Sure. But compared to the kitchen, the bathroom poses additional recycling roadblocks that arguably make it one of the biggest offenders in the house \\u2014 one problem simply being the physical location of most home's recycling bins which are typically *wipes sweat off forehead* multiple steps away from the bathroom. But even if regular people were more dependably diligent about making sure bathroom empties made it to the recycling, it's unlikely that most of that plastic would actually be recycled after it's out of the consumer's hands. Only around 5% of plastic actually gets recycled at the waste facility level, and the types of plastic commonly found in bathroom products complicate the process even further.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The Lomi countertop composter makes recycling food scraps as easy as loading the dishwasher\\n            \\n\\n\\nOf course PET, one of the cheapest and easiest materials to make, is also one of the biggest pains to recycle. This is especially true when the different numbers (like PET 1 through 6) are mixed together to make up different parts of a bottle or container yet can't be recycled together \\u2014 or at all, depending on the rules in your area. Unfortunately, the mere presence of the triangular arrow graphic on a bottle is often an empty promise. And in a world where single-use plastic has been made ubiquitous by the companies we have no choice but to buy from, even the most actively sustainable people aren't immune to excessive packaging or soap hand pumps that can't be recycled. But we do have opportunities to be thoughtful about our bathroom habits beyond switching to organic cotton towels. There are a ton of zero-waste and low-waste swaps you can make that replace the single-use items you already use.1. Chewable toothpaste\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRefills come in a brown paper package.\\nCredit: Bite\\n\\n\\nColgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble have made the list of the world's biggest plastic polluters for a few years now. They also happen to be the companies that own Colgate and Crest. Switching to environmentally friendly toothpaste, like these chewable tablets from Bite, is a big way to cut off support for such companies. Don't worry \\u2014 they foam like regular toothpaste, taste perfectly minty, and come in a refillable glass jar. Grab a one-month supply for $12 or start a customizable subscription.Writer's note: I have been using Bite toothpaste tablets for almost three years now and they are one of my all-time favorite discoveries. Letting a crusty, non-recyclable tube sit on my counter? Couldn't be me.2. Bamboo toilet paper\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, you don't have to use brown toilet paper.\\nCredit: Reel\\n\\n\\nThough regular TP breaks down pretty quickly post-use, its real environmental cost was already cemented during production. Despite the Charmin bears' best efforts to convince everyone that less is more, our demand causes the cutting and pulping of 27,000 trees in a single day and 37 gallons of water for a single roll.Bamboo is a champion carbon sequester and can grow up to three feet in a day (without a shit ton of water or pesticides speeding up the process). Reel isn't the only company that utilizes bamboo fibers to wipe, but it may just be the softest and most durable 3-ply bamboo TP on the market.Writer's note: I've gotten compliments from multiple guests about how nice my Reel toilet paper is. Because it's white like regular toilet paper, they're wow-ed when I say it's bamboo.3. A reusable cotton swab\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLastSwab comes in multiple colors and special designs for makeup and baby ears.\\nCredit: LastObject\\n\\n\\nAs many as 1.5 billion cotton swabs (all but guaranteed to be single-use) are produced every day \\u2014\\xa0and though we only use them for a few seconds, even the ones that don't have plastic handles end up littering landfills and oceans, much like straws. Switching to LastSwab, a reusable silicone swab, can save you from tossing up to 1,000 Q-tips. Its cute, colorful case also nixes the need for a container to hold a handful of swabs.Writer's note: My audiologist friends say we shouldn't really be cleaning our ears at all, but it feels... so... good. My LastSwab is even more satisfying than a regular cotton Q-tip.4. Biodegradable floss picks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet biodegradable floss picks in mint or charcoal.\\nCredit: The Humble Co.\\n\\n\\nFloss picks make the flossing process so much less annoying compared to those boxes that the dentist hands out. But throwing away so many plastic picks after 30 seconds of use isn't the move. These revolutionary picks from The Humble Co. are made with corn starch, come in paper packaging, and have double-threaded minty strands. This is also our way of insinuating that you should probably floss if you haven't recently.5. Plant-based toothbrushes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBristles are a different color on each brush to avoid mix-ups.\\nCredit: The Humble Co.\\n\\n\\nThrowing away a plastic toothbrush once every few months may not seem like a huge deal. But, consider for a moment that your tossed toothbrush will take up to 400 years to decompose. Now think about the fact that one billion toothbrushes are thrown out every year, making it a habit that becomes problematic real quick. Cornstarch-based toothbrushes are biodegradable, offer the same soft bristles, and feel less splinter-y than bamboo handles. 6. A reusable razor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Billie razor comes in six colors.\\nCredit: Billie\\n\\n\\nIf you thought the stats on plastic toothbrushes were bad, just know that double the number of plastic razors (double as in two billion) are thrown away each year. Billie's reusable razors are encased in aloe flex to minimize prickles, and only require you to switch out the metal blade. Get the starter kit (the razor, a magnetic holder for the wall, and five-blade refills) for $10, then $10 for each set of refills going forward.7. Washable cotton round replacements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe LastRound carrying case comes in six colors.\\nCredit: LastObject\\n\\n\\nAfter years of collective hating on the makeup wipe, many have moved on to cotton rounds. But their environmental impact isn't zero, either. The water wasted and pesticides used in the cotton growing process is the main offender, though the cheap bleached ones don't exactly biodegrade well.These reusable cotton rounds by LastObject are the shape and size you're used to, but can be hand-washed with soap or thrown in the washing machine. For $14, LastRound comes with seven compostable rounds (with up to 1,750 uses in each) in a carrying case made from recycled plastic. The new LastRound Pro rounds are black instead of white, specifically for removing heavy makeup or nail polish.8. A silicone body scrubber\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Boie is available in multiple colors and designs.\\nCredit: Boie\\n\\n\\nTraditional synthetic loofahs are breeding grounds for bacteria. However, the solution of replacing them every four to six weeks sucks just as much when their plastic composition takes hundreds of years to decompose. The Boie scrubber's antimicrobial surface gets super sudsy and exfoliates skin, and can be rinsed clean. Boies are recyclable and can be sent back to the company for proper recycling.Writer's note: Some reviews assert that the Boie is impossible to hold. The holes for your fingers may take a little getting used to, but it's certainly not so difficult that I'd stan a dirty loofah. Plus, there's also a Boie that features a loop on the back instead.9. Oxybenzone-free sunscreen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSun Bum also offers a 50 SPF Oxybenzone-free, non-mineral sunscreen,\\nCredit: Sun Bum\\n\\n\\nThe sunscreen that seeps off of ocean dwellers' skin is contributing to the ongoing destruction of coral reefs. Oxybenzone, a main ingredient in traditional sunscreen, gets sucked in by the coral and seriously disrupts their ability to absorb UV light and reproduce (hence coral bleaching). An estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen ends up in coral reefs each year. While regular chemical sunscreens without oxybenzone do exist, mineral sunscreen is completely chemical-free. Reviewers of this spray version from Sun Bum mention that it's the least residue-y mineral sunscreen they've tried.10. Shampoo bars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kitsch\\n\\n\\nEven the most minimal shower routines are likely contributors to the beauty industry's shampoo bottle problem. Only a small sliver of the 552 million that are sold in the U.S. each year actually get recycled, while the majority of those empties end up in the landfill. Switching to shampoo bars could save two bottles of liquid stuff from entering waste circulation. Award-winning options from TikTok viral brand Kitsch are customizable for your hair's needs just like bottled shampoo, including a rice water formula for hair growth or a purple toning bar for bleach upkeep.11. Compostable bamboo bandages\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPatch bandages also come in activated charcoal, aloe vera, or coconut oil.\\nCredit: Patch\\n\\n\\nThe materials used in a classic Band-Aid seem innocent. Unfortunately, most of them are made from plastic, rubber, or latex, and don't naturally break down in the environment.

In doing so, they captured the first photographs of Earth from space.

American researchers used the V-2 rocket, fit with scientific instruments, to improve their understanding of the great black ether, space. In this case, they wanted to grasp the origin of galactic cosmic rays (particles from deep space that incessantly bombard Earth), explained Martin Collins, a space historian and curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. \\n    \"There seems to be an irresistible tendency to look back at home.\"\\n    \\n\"The photograph was a kind of side effect of this other primary purpose,\" Collins said. When the V-2's film finally plummeted down to Earth, and survived, scientists at New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range were reportedly enthused by the never-seen-before, grainy view. \"...when they first projected [the photos] onto the screen, the scientists just went nuts,\" Fred Rulli, who\\xa0recovered the V-2 film from the desert floor after the rocket fell back through the atmosphere and crashed on the ground, told Air and Space Magazine in 2006.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first picture of Earth from space, taken on\\xa0Oct. 24, 1946.\\nCredit: White Sands Missile Range / Applied Physics Laboratory\\n\\n\\nThe first images of Earth, though low-resolution and ghostly, arrived at a time when space and defense technology was rapidly advancing. There was the space race, wherein the U.S. famously sent astronauts to the moon but also spent two decades hard at work on a nuclear power-rocket bound for Mars (the disbanded Project Rover). There was the creation of advanced defense missiles, scattered around the country, designed to shoot down Soviet bombers during the Cold War. Even electric guitars were shaped by the futuristic, stratospheric zeitgeist. The first photographs of Earth were a fitting start to this new age.\"It captured that sense of change,\" said Collins.Fourteen years later, Americans didn't have to wait for any film to plunge through Earth's atmosphere to glimpse the latest view of the planet. Now, it was televised. On April 1, 1960, the TIROS-1 weather satellite transmitted photos back to Earth. The next day, The New York Times published these images on the front page under the headline: \"U.S. ORBITS WEATHER SATELLITE; IT TELEVISES EARTH AND STORMS; NEW ERA IN METEOROLOGY SEEN.\"TIROS-1, which was built with the help of the U.S. Army Signal Research and Development Lab, the electronics company RCA, NASA, and others, might have been designed for weather, but it also made a poignant statement on burgeoning satellite reconnaissance, meaning the ability of advancing satellite technology to potentially spy on others' activities around the world. \"In that 1960s moment, the Cold War context was not lost,\" noted Collins.Orbiting 450 miles above Earth, TIROS-1 lasted for 78 days and snapped 19,389 pictures, including a typhoon east of Australia. More TIROS satellites soon followed, and for years later black and white images of Earth's swirling atmosphere ended up in newspapers.As a kid in the 1970s, Jeff Weber, now a research meteorologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, used to await the daily image of clouds over the U.S., printed each day in the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph. A young, weather-obsessed Weber collected each photo to watch how the weather changed.\"It was so obvious how weather patterns were moving across the country,\" said Weber. Decades later, Weber's still watching the weather, albeit on computers with imagery taken by significantly advanced National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites \\u2014 like the one that now spies churning hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I look at satellite imagery pretty much all day, every day now,\" he said.

Three years before Neil Armstrong would cautiously step onto the chalky lunar ground, the robotic craft Lunar Orbiter 1 snapped the first view of Earth taken by a spacecraft near the Moon. But like the V-2 rocket image, the mission wasn't intended to snap pictures of Earth. It was to collect detailed images of the Moon's cratered, perilous surface, where astronauts would soon try to land.In the foreground is a mottled lunar surface pocked with billions of years worth of impact craters. Beyond lies cloud-covered Earth.\"It was great,\" NASA's Barry said of the image. But a picture from Lunar Orbitor 1 didn't make the front page of The New York Times, like TIROS-1. It didn't make the second, third, fourth, or fifth pages either. Why, this historic image was buried on page 14. That's because, by 1966, NASA astronauts had already shot stunning, colorized photographs of Earth, notably the 1965 image of Ed White floating above the vivid, hazy blue atmosphere, connected to a spacecraft by just a tether. Then, of course, came one of the most famous pictures of Earth ever snapped, the \"Blue Marble\" photo taken en route to the Moon during the final Apollo mission in 1972.  These pictures overshadowed the 1966 image.\"It's mostly forgotten because of the nice color pictures we got later,\" said Barry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn image of Earth taken by Lunar Orbiter 1 on Aug. 23, 1966.\\nCredit: NASA\\n\\n\\nRobotic endeavors into deeper and deeper space still kept looking back home, long after the pictures of Earth weren't novel any longer.

For now, anyway.\\xa0In true Succession fashion, the funeral of patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) proved to be another playground for business deals and board meetings, with the Roys discovering an item that upends the playing field. Turns out that Logan's left a paper in a safe, and on this paper is a bold sentence declaring that Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) should take over as Waystar's CEO after Logan passes away. (After much discussion among the three siblings, Roman and Kendall decide to share the mantle of interim CEO, but we're focusing on the paper here, people.)From the gang's many (many) examinations of this paper, we learn that along with Logan's declaration are two pencil markings that are up for interpretation. One is a line underneath Kendall's name, which could be a simple, emphatic underline \\u2014 or as Shiv (Sarah Snook) aptly points out, a strikethrough. (I agree with Shiv, for the record!) The other is Cousin Greg's (Nicholas Braun) name, followed by question marks.\\xa0The paper quickly becomes a holy grail of sorts, with all of the top players bickering over it to deny or embolden their claim to the Waystar throne. Kendall evidently finds undeniable meaning in this paper, while Shiv thinks it's just some useless document that Logan probably was doodling on. But what really is the deal with this paper? And is its outcome something Logan would have actually wanted? Let's dive in.\\xa0When did Logan write the paper?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: \\xa0David Russell/HBO \\n\\n\\nFrank (Peter Friedman) estimates that Logan might have written the paper four years ago, which means he likely wrote it during Season 1. The timeline's perfectly aligns with Succession's pilot episode, when Kendall was supposed to be named CEO before Logan eventually backed out and decided not to retire. If we dig in deeper to Season 1, Logan also had his first major health scare in those first few episodes, which hints that he might have drafted the paper during that time out of fear of his declining health. But the timeline of when he came back to the paper to write on it is harder to answer.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Have 'Succession' and 'The Last of Us' started the next big TV trend?\\n            \\n\\n\\nIf we were to assume that Logan wrote Greg's name and underlined (or scratched out) Kendall's name at the same time, then it was likely to have happened at some point between the end of Season 2 and the start of Season 3. Waystar was in the middle of its huge, stock-crashing, cruise ship scandal. Kendall was supposed to take the fall and accept the blame for the company's massive coverup (which meant he'd be going to jail), but he backed out and instead dropped a bomb in the finale that his dad was actually responsible \\u2014 which set the course for Season 3 and served as Kendall's ultimate betrayal of his father.Throughout the cruise ship ordeal, Greg remained a steady pillar with a go-getter attitude ready to do anything and everything for Logan \\u2014 including testify before Congress. It's possible that Logan saw some form of loyalty in Greg that could be nourished and fine-tuned to become a CEO or at least a partner of some sort, leading him to write Greg's name on the paper as a really hard \"maybe.\"\\xa0What can we gather from Logan's pencil markings?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: \\xa0David Russell/HBO \\n\\n\\nAt the end of the episode, we watch Kendall zooming in on a picture of his name on the paper, and while it does arguably look crossed out, that doesn't really matter. If Logan realized he didn't want Kendall to be CEO, he surely could have just ripped up the paper and tossed it away. Why would he come back to it, write some things on it, and keep it in his safe if he was so convinced he didn't want Kendall? From Logan's pencil markings, we can gather that he came back to the paper at some point, and while he may have been hesitant, a part of him was still sure of his initial decision.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Succession' Season 4, episode 4: What does Kerry whisper to Roman?\\n            \\n\\n\\nWe can also assume that Logan knew this paper would be found at some point. If he really didn't want the aftermath it'd trigger, he would have gotten rid of it entirely, no matter when he wrote it. But Greg's name being on there might suggest that Logan wasn't necessarily in the right mindset. The last person capable of running Waystar is Greg, and while it does cater to certain Cousin Greg fan theories, it's hard to imagine Logan actually entrusting him with his life's work. Maybe Logan saw something in Greg that audiences haven't, or maybe this entire paper was in fact Logan's sketchpad he'd hoped no one would find as he ruminated over his successor.\\xa0There's no way of telling, but it's safe to say that if Logan really never wanted this specific piece of paper to be found, he would have shredded it. He was certainly no stranger to shredding papers.\\xa0Did Logan actually want Kendall to be CEO?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike father, like son? \\nCredit: Macall B. Polay/HBO\\n\\n\\nA Shakespearean betrayal is at the heart of Logan and Kendall's relationship, but perhaps that's precisely why Logan saw him as CEO material. There's a clear ferociousness in Kendall that his siblings don't harbor, and by the tone of the last words Logan speaks onscreen  \\u2014 \"Clean out the stalls. Strategic refocus. A bit more fucking aggressive!\" \\u2014 he's clearly a fan of hostility as a means to an end. And Kendall's ready to get fucking aggressive.\\xa0By the end of episode 4, Kendall pulls a move Logan would have been impressed by, had his reputation not been its target; Kendall goes behind his siblings' back to greenlight some shady PR moves in order to bolster his and Roman's positions as Waystar's interim CEOs. He justifies his choice by saying Logan would have done the same thing, and he's right. Kendall's ready to adopt his dad's anger and use it to stay on top. Maybe Logan never wanted Kendall to be CEO, but his son's stepping up regardless.At the end of the day, the intentions behind Logan's paper don't really matter in the face of his kids' reactions. Perhaps there was a part of Logan that always hoped for Kendall to be CEO, which would explain why the paper's still in the safe. Perhaps he forgot about the paper and thought no one would ever find it, but that seems highly unlikely. All we can hope for is a flashback scene to the moment Logan wrote it for some definitive answers. Who knows? Maybe Kendall really was the lion's favorite cub all along.\\xa0Succession is now streaming on HBO Max, with new episodes airing at 9 p.m. ET Sundays on HBO and HBO Max.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/succession-season-4-episode-4-logan-will", "pubDate": "Mon, 17 Apr 2023 02:00:00 +0000"}, {"title": "'Succession' Season 4, episode 4: What does Kerry whisper to Roman?", "description": "Logan may be gone, but the Roy family lives on in Succession.

Presumably she wants Roman to check if Logan had started any of the paperwork to divorce Marcia, or if he'd written down his plans or told them to anyone else.Whatever Logan may have said, though, he obviously didn't live long enough to put his words into action \\u2014 so why does it even matter?Well, the first point is that Kerry clearly isn't going anywhere. She's not just going to go back \"to her little apartment\", as Marcia refers to it, and it seems clear that she's not about to let Logan's family sweep her under the rug. We also know from the final scene of episode 4 that Kendall has put in motion a PR plan to paint their father in a negative light, and make it seem like he, Roman, and Shiv (Sarah Snook) were already running things at Waystar Royco before he died. A part of that plan might involve bringing up the bad things Logan did, including \"the Kerry situation\", as Hugo (Fisher Stevens) refers to it.Finally, we know that Kerry had aspirations to be an anchor at ATN, despite Tom (Matthew McFadyen) and Greg's (Nicholas Braun) feedback. She wants to be on camera. Is all of this pointing to a series of sit-down interviews in which Kerry reveals everything about the true nature of her relationship with Logan?

Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) is, in fact, pregnant.\\xa0Following last week\\u2019s explosive revelations, episode 4 of Succession maintains the momentum with two plot-changing reveals. We first learn that Shiv is 20 weeks into her pregnancy. And we then learn that Logan (Brian Cox) has left a paper, akin to a will, that bestows Waystar to Kendall (Jeremy Strong). After several power plays during Logan\\u2019s funeral, team Roy arrives at a winning conclusion that sees Kendall and Roman (Kieran Culkin) both acting as interim CEOs in the immediate aftermath of their father\\u2019s passing. But why did Succession decide to drop these two bombs in the same episode?\\xa0Shiv\\u2019s pregnancy, which so far seems to be a secret, might have sealed a fate she clearly doesn\\u2019t want. When Kendall whips up the CEO plan that involves Roman by his side, Shiv is visibly upset \\u2014 partially because she wants the position, and partially because she\\u2019s aware that her pregnancy might stop her from getting it. There\\u2019s a clear billionaire boys club forming, and Shiv\\u2019s not just being benched on the sidelines; her pregnancy might mean she\\u2019s being pushed to the last row of the audience.\\xa0Succession\\u2019s never shied away from tackling gender in the workplace, with the politics of that usually explored through Shiv. For the past four seasons, we\\u2019ve seen Shiv deal with misogyny, with Logan\\u2019s colleagues deeming her unfit for the title position as his daughter, not his son. Shiv was only ever \\u201cuseful\\u201d to the company when her gender could be tokenized, like when they needed a female spokesperson to defend Waystar amid the sexual harassment scandal. Her pregnancy, paired with Kendall and Roman\\u2019s decision, brings her gender even more to the forefront.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShiv's as isolated as ever. \\nCredit: David Russell / HBO\\n\\n\\nWomen already have it tough in the workplace (to say the least), and pregnancy elevates that tenfold. There\\u2019s the immediate, incorrect presumption that new mothers are a liability, wrongly forced to choose between work or their kids. As soon as Kendall, Roman, and Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) find out Shiv\\u2019s pregnant, we can expect them to leave her out of Waystar matters even more than they already are.

And now, in the wake of Logan's shocking Season 4 death, Succession finally answers that question. Kind of.Season 4, episode 4, \"Honeymoon States,\" dives into the fallout of Logan's passing, including pressing issues like whether the GoJo deal is still on. Of course, the biggest matter at hand is who will lead Waystar next. With a board call swiftly approaching, the clock is ticking for the Waystar crew to choose the new interim CEO. It's a job everyone is gunning for, from Waystar's old guard like Gerri (J. Smith-Cameron) and Karl (David Rasche) to the Roy siblings Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook), and Roman (Kieran Culkin). By the episode's end, we officially have a new, non-Logan CEO, but remember: This is only a temporary arrangement. Anything could happen in the coming weeks.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Have 'Succession' and 'The Last of Us' started the next big TV trend?\\n            \\n\\n\\nWho is the new CEO of Waystar Royco?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBehold the new CEOs.\\nCredit: David Russell/HBO\\n\\n\\nIn a surprising turn of events, Waystar Royco gets two interim CEOs for the price of one: Kendall and Roman. While the brothers step up together, they get there in varying ways.The question of Kendall's appointment is one of the major dilemmas of the episode. Frank (Peter Friedman), acting as one of Logan's executors, finds a piece of paper in Logan's private safe that dictates his last wishes, like funeral arrangements and who he wants to succeed him as CEO. According to the paper, Logan named Kendall. However, basically everyone wants this role, so the episode features a lot of hand-wringing about the validity of the paper.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The internet reacts to *that* shocking 'Succession' twist\\n            \\n\\n\\nOne argument against this all-powerful piece of paper is that it's undated. Frank estimates it could be from four years ago...you know, back before Kendall and Logan's extremely public feud. Shiv also points out that the markings around Kendall's name \\u2014 which many people interpret as an emphatic underlining \\u2014 might actually be Logan crossing his name out entirely. In true Succession fashion, the scene balances brutal hilarity and total cringe-worthiness as everyone attempts to twist these minutiae to their benefit. The award for most embarrassing move has to go to Greg (Nicholas Braun) though, as he tries to convince everyone present that Logan's annotation of \"Greg???\" meant he wanted him as Kendall's second. Keep dreaming, Disgusting Brother.Having his name on this piece of paper bolsters Kendall to fight harder for the interim CEO position. He cozies up to key shareholder Sandy Furness (Larry Pine) and tells close friend (and another key shareholder) Stewy (Arian Moayed) about the paper. In turn, he forces his siblings to consider their options: Either one of them (likely him) becomes CEO, or a member of the old guard who doubts their capabilities takes over.It's at this point that Roman fully puts his hat in the ring. As Waystar's COO, he is listed on the company's draft plan as the person who should step up. He's close with GoJo's Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsg\\xe5rd) and was speaking to Logan more than Kendall and Shiv were before his death.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How 'Succession' helped me grieve the loss of my father\\n            \\n\\n\\nKendall immediately sides with Roman, saying the two of them can take the position together. Their deal leaves Shiv out in the cold, but with two siblings against one, Kendall and Roman have a majority. They convince the board of their vision \\u2014 remember, this is all temporary for now, just enough to make sure the GoJo deal goes through \\u2014 and shoulder their dad's former mantle together.With Kendall and Roman as CEO, what happens to Shiv?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat about Shivvy?\\nCredit: David Russell/HBO\\n\\n\\nKendall and Roman tell Shiv that the pair of them as CEO is clean. Add her as a third, and it becomes messy \\u2014 or, as Roman puts it, it becomes \"some orgy for hippies.\" Still, the two insist that she would still be inside the company, and that she would be involved in everything.\"And that's all equal?\" Shiv asks.\"Equal as fuck,\" Kendall replies. \"To the gram.\"The brothers promise on the events of the day prior \\u2014 Logan's death \\u2014 that they won't screw Shiv over. Still, this is Succession, a show where you can depend just as much on people screwing each other over as you can count on the opening credits playing every week. The siblings may be grieving their father together, but they're also Roys. The likelihood that Kendall and Roman stick to their word is not great.We can already see the Roy-on-Roy backstabbing towards the end of the episode, when Kendall tells Hugo (Fisher Stevens) to prepare hit pieces about Logan for when Kendall and Roman become CEO. It's a move that goes directly behind Roman's back, as he wanted nothing to do with the plan to \"shit on Dad.\" And if this underhanded plot is just Kendall's first move as interim CEO, what can we expect going forward?

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a double letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?No.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?A, S, N, and D.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

He said he \"always knew\" he was gay.\\xa0\"For a lot of my life I was very quiet, trying to hide pieces of myself,\\u201d he said. In high school, he got \"crushes\" on girls and women he admired. During his freshman year at college he came out at bisexual and, a few years later, as gay.The first person he told that he kissed a boy was his best friend \\u2014 a person he met in high school who he still considers his best friend; he describes her as \"me as a woman.\" She is not very online and, Sede\\xf1o confesses, that's a trend in his friendships: Most of them are not online and even his real-life friends who are online don't ask him to collaborate. None of his childhood friends have ever tried to reconnect in any kind of gross, clout-chasing way, which might be a reflection of Sede\\xf1o himself \\u2014 he never tries to mine his friends for content and, in return, they respect him as a person first and a content creator second.Sede\\xf1o's dream to be his true self, come out of his shell, and wear wigs like Raven Simone didn't happen in high school. But he felt more free to express himself online. One of his best-performing videos, posted in October 2022 with 2.3 million views, is of him in a long black wig reimagining scenes from Twilight as Jacob. The video is captioned, \"Jacob Black if he slayed.\"\"Eric is someone who is exactly who he is online,\" Tefi Pessoa, another creator who knows Sede\\xf1o through TikTok, told me, adding that he is someone warm, who smiles at you and goes in for a hug as soon as you walk into the door. Pessoa is one of Sede\\xf1o's all-time favorite creators on the app. \"I am not surprised so many people have gravitated towards him because he really is the kind of friend you pray for as a kid. And he kills it in a wig, bitch.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVia Giphy(opens in a new tab)\\n\\nSede\\xf1o, an art director, graphic designer, and illustrator on top of his TikTok work, left Texas to live away from home for the first time for an internship in advertising in 2018 in New York City. He downloaded TikTok in 2019 for an advertising campaign and, at first, he said he \"didn't get it.\" As he kept scrolling, the app grew on him. On a whim, he started posting to his 20 or so buddies who followed him there. It was March 2020, the beginning of stay at home measures for the covid-19 pandemic, he had just been dumped, he had just chopped off all of his hair, and he had just moved into a new apartment.\\xa0The oldest video on his page displays a peak pandemic experience. It is March 17, 2020, and he's recording himself striking some poses in a Zoom class. \"Trying to act shy and innocent so my crush notices me during my virtual class,\" he wrote in the caption.\\xa0\"I just had so much alone time and I'm a very social creature,\" Sede\\xf1o said of those early videos. \"It was my way of being social by myself while I had to be at home working. It never felt awkward.\"\\xa0 Eventually, the views on his videos started stacking up. His first viral video showed him shaking his ass and garnered about 17,000 views. The second, a video of him asking his audience if he looked intimidating, reached more than 500,000 views.\\xa0He starts to develop a repertoire: he follows a trend, or he shakes his ass to whatever sound is popular on the app that day, or he tells stories directly to the camera. Sede\\xf1o\\u2019s joy comes through even in his earliest videos.\\xa0\"I feel like I started TikTok because I loved myself and I loved what I was doing and I was like, 'Let me show other people,'\" Sede\\xf1o said.As pandemic restrictions lifted, other people started occasionally popping into his videos, but that was still quite rare. Some of his videos use the #foryoupage tag \\u2013 generally deployed by creators to help their videos go viral \\u2013 and others don't. Sede\\xf1o is smart. He knows that his videos have the potential to get views, and also preserves a feeling that his content is a glimpse into something candid, as if his joy is so radiant that it simply must be captured and shared. Nothing reads as rehearsed or practiced. He seems to be having a silly, goofy, slightly unhinged time.From the start,\\xa0 Sede\\xf1o seemed to naturally know a central fact about being online that others take years to learn. \"The first step to doing anything well is to enjoy yourself and be yourself doing that thing,\" Sede\\xf1o said. \"I started TikTok because I loved myself and I loved what I was doing and I wanted to show other people.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlay!!\\nCredit: Molly Flores\\n\\n\\nNow, Sede\\xf1o, aka @RicoTaquito, has over 1 million social media followers and over 81 million likes.

It can be a cruel place,\" Sede\\xf1o said. \"I've had moments where I'm like, 'Oh my God, people are so mean.'\"\\xa0He said he feels like some people don't want to hear about his problems, and he doesn't necessarily want to share all of them, either. Being a creator like Sede\\xf1o involves finding a balance between sharing parts of your life that your audience wants to know and that makes them feel connected to you, all while maintaining boundaries and privacy. Getting the balance wrong in either direction can result in alarming consequences.\"I'm OK with not sharing everything with the whole world,\" Sede\\xf1o said. \"I skew towards, like, if I'm not having the best day, I'm not gonna fake it. If I'm not in a funny mood, I'm not gonna force myself to sit down and make content.\"Sede\\xf1o, like all of us, sometimes feels the urge to post his way through an upsetting or difficult moment. He has, in the past, taken those videos down a few hours later.\\xa0But, usually, he is in a funny mood. He says he tries to start every day with a smile, and people online are mostly kind to him. \"For me, who you see online is who you get in person. And so it's very authentically just me being myself,\" something the internet seems to respond to. That also means, though, that trolls can cut deep. \"When people don't like me, it used to hurt me a lot because it really is me,\" he said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubtle but slay.\\nCredit: Molly Flores\\n\\n\\nHe has no plans to stop making videos any time soon, but he also wants to spend more time focusing on other creative pursuits. He's a brilliant artist and designer, and recently made a zine that he hopes to start selling. He wants to make an interactive website and \\u2014 for what it's worth \\u2014 it's looking pretty good right now. He wants to start a podcast this year. These are all things he has wanted to do for a while, he tells me, but his word for 2023 is \"consistency.\" He will get it done, he promises.Like any creator, Sede\\xf1o is looking for ways to monetize his following by tapping into the joy his followers turn to him to see and feel. The cynical part of me wants to see this as the TikTok version of a \"choose joy\" farmhouse sign. But sitting across from him, it is difficult to feel cynical. I'm reminded of the early days of the pandemic, when he first joined TikTok. Every day we were surrounded by uncertainty and fear. Finding any joy at that time was an act of resilience and resistance. When Sede\\xf1o first started making his videos, he chose joy on TikTok. He never stopped.\\xa0I'm taken by his perseverance and consistency, by his devotion to joy. His steadfast commitment to joy on social media \\u2014 a place quite literally designed to make users unhappy \\u2014 reminds me of meteorologists on the news during a hurricane, standing in the middle of the storm and giving the report despite the conditions that demand they stop. He's not impervious to the effects of his surroundings, but he isn't budging.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulie Gees is a slay!!\\nCredit: Molly Flores\\n\\n\\nAfter we got our nails done, we walked over to get a slice of pizza at Paulie Gee's in Greenpoint.

I'm not a firbolg cleric, I'm a person with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) aspiring to role-play in Dungeons & Dragons as one, and before I called on OpenAI's ChatGPT for help I was frozen, staring at a blank character sheet and unsure where to begin.ADHD, a condition estimated to affect 4.4 percent of U.S. adults, typically is characterized by a cluster of issues: inattention, impulsive behaviors, and hyperactivity. I was diagnosed earlier this year, in my late 30s, with the inattentive type, and I'm constantly fighting with myself to avoid side quests.My diagnosis was made just as generative AI tools like the ChatGPT chatbot became accessible to the public and the world clambered to explore their uses. While browsing the r/ADHD subreddit for ideas on how to work with my brain a little bit better, I saw a few people praising the chatbot's potential as a tool to improve executive function \\u2014 using ChatGPT to sort through email backlogs and generate professional-sounding responses, organizing prioritized to-do lists, and overcoming ADHD paralysis, a common symptom of ADHD marked by an inability to function effectively. To test this out for myself, I prompted ChatGPT to help me complete a task I've been putting off: creating an original playable character for a tabletop role-playing game.Rolling with a ChatGPT advantageWhile I knew I wanted to create a firbolg cleric and had given thought to themes and motivations, I was overwhelmed by the prospect of producing a comprehensive character sheet that tracks everything from the character's name, to the items they carry, their individual attribute scores, and other important details that make the game come alive. I've had trouble concentrating on this undertaking even while using online character builders like D&D Beyond. Although this is a task I have done before, I found myself preferring to retreat back into the comfortable zone of vaguely imagining the outline of this character, rather than actually doing the work of making them playable in a specific campaign. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Users who spot bugs in ChatGPT can now make up to $20,000\\n            \\n\\n\\nChatGPT was most helpful when I asked it to help me organize my thoughts and stay focused while brainstorming my character's basic outline, taking each field one at a time. When I asked the chatbot to detail relevant domains for my cleric (vital characteristics related to abilities, spells, and areas of influence) with pros and cons for each choice, the result was a basic but accurate list that more or less aligned with my own previous research. ChatGPT asked me good, if generic, questions that served as writing prompts for this character, which allowed me to give focused thought to how I might represent them within the mechanics of the game.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nThe end result was a perfectly serviceable sketch of a firbolg nature cleric who was struggling to understand the conflicting values of two beloved mentors. ChatGPT was even able to conduct a short but cogent dialogue role-play with me, with the AI serving as a Game Master (GM), so that I could try out a couple personality choices and dialogue styles. At this point, I felt better prepared to complete creating the character, ideally in conversation with a real human GM, having made some key decisions and given some thought to how those choices might translate into the game itself. But when I asked ChatGPT to help me deepen my research on firbolgs, a fictional race of giant-like creatures with a culture that draws substantially from Celtic folklore, the chatbot briefly lost its \"mind.\"A disappointing history checkAfter talking through my character with ChatGPT, I asked, \"I'd like to research the real-life inspiration for the firbolg character. Can you give me some sources I could read or contact about the role of Celtic culture in Dungeons & Dragons?\" For its first attempt, ChatGPT provided me with a list of five suggestions, including articles that appeared to be misidentified or inaccessible online. The first suggestion pointed to a scholarly publication I could not track down, which, upon further prompting, ChatGPT clarified was a book, not a journal \\u2014 but I could not find any published work matching the citation provided. When I asked ChatGPT for links to the resources it recommended, including an Atlas Obscura article and a piece from the official Dungeons & Dragons site, I was provided with a series of dead ends, including broken links and titles of out-of-print materials. When I repeated my initial question, regenerating responses several times, the results were somewhat better. Not every recommendation appeared to be fully accurate information, but the chatbot did point me to a few readily available reference books on Celtic folklore, and listed some relevant scholars. However, in one manual Google search, I was able to find a collection of much more helpful, pertinent articles and resources.Generative AI generates. When you struggle to overcome the terror of a blank sheet, tools like ChatGPT can be enormously helpful in opening the gates to creative work. But as many others have noted, tools like ChatGPT have not demonstrated that they deserve your trust. Getting to the encounterGenerative AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Google's Bard are the center of conversations these days about the future of tech, ranging from professional applications, to the arts, to travel, accessibility, and more. Said conversations are evolving as fast as the technology itself, with evangelists promoting hype about how generative AI is about to revolutionize and dominate everything from education to creative expression to software development, and others warning against rushing to give these brand new tools critical responsibilities.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The ChatGPT bug exposed more private data than previously thought, OpenAI confirms\\n            \\n\\n\\nIndeed, many of the central problems of the current tech landscape (including bias and exploitation) appear to be simply replicated in this newest generation of technology.\\xa0And, there are huge privacy issues with using a bot \\u2014 designed to absorb and share data it's provided \\u2014 to handle sensitive medical information. Still, experts see some potential in these tools for people with ADHD, so long as there's an understanding of what they can and cannot do. \"Probably the most powerful aspect of it related to ADHD is going to be in overcoming procrastination,\" said Lara Honos-Webb, a clinical psychologist who specializes in Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and ADHD and is the co-founder of a startup aimed at helping those managing ADHD. Honos-Webb said that she'd been playing around with ChatGPT herself, and believes that it could have beneficial applications for some with the disorder, particularly with the inattentive subtype.\\xa0\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nIn addition to organizing thoughts, Honos-Webb said, ChatGPT might also come in handy as a memory device, since the tool can log past conversations and generate a topical label for them. So you could, for instance, brainstorm in a chat with ChatGPT as if you were talking to a friend or a peer in your industry. The chat itself would then become your conversation notes. Using it might also help reduce distractions, Honos-Webb added. As someone whose tab count on my phone's browser has long read \"99+\" I can see the appeal of having one single interface for looking things up. The problem is, that information isn't always going to be correct, relevant, or complete.For Brayden Motion, a 23-year-old software developer with ADHD who dabbles in music and creative writing, ChatGPT has been a helpful assistant for generating ideas and how-to guides. People with ADHD can struggle to stick to new activities, Motion noted, especially when excellence at a hobby or career choice takes planning and work \\u2014 as most do.\\xa0\"You can ask ChatGPT how to accomplish something such as writing a novel or creating a successful company and get an outline of the entire process,\" Motion said. \"I have also used ChatGPT to find what jobs or careers would best suit me based on my individual needs and ADHD symptoms.\"He's found ChatGPT to be really useful, but only as a guide. \"When I realized I could use ChatGPT to break down tasks for me, I expected a huge shift in my life,\" he said. \"But it turns out you still need to put in the work in your daily life! Who would've thought?\"Clearing the way for my own spellcastingThere is another, particular risk for people with ADHD leaning too hard on tools like this \\u2014 the temptation to push procrastination even further. Before getting to step one of my firbolg design process, I was distracted time and time again: I was thirsty, so I grabbed a glass of water. On the way back to my seat, I noticed that the stairs needed to be vacuumed. As I cleaned, I began to think of all the other things I needed to do: plant flowers outside, update my insurance information at the pharmacy... Where did I put my water glass? As Honos-Webb noted to me, many people with ADHD like to test limits \\u2014 how long can I delay starting on this task and get away with it? ChatGPT may provide the illusion of a solution here, by producing outlines, direction, and even full essays for, say, that term paper due in 12 hours. While the ChatGPT answer might sound good, these tools repeatedly have been caught in the act of making up academic sources and confidently stating nonsense as fact. And that's not even getting into the chatbot's potential for facilitating plagiarism.That said, when I leaned on ChatGPT for a prioritized to-do list to organize the tasks cluttering my brain, it was extremely helpful in breaking through the chaos to allow me to take action on each of these items. But the most important limitation was one I kept asking myself about while endlessly searching for ADHD \"hacks\" and hoping for a nice, focused day after one conversation with an AI bot: Just what is ChatGPT \"improving\" about someone with ADHD anyway?Honos-Webb's research has focused on the strengths of the condition, the flip sides of struggling with emotional regulation, factual memorization, and attention to detail, to name a few common symptoms of ADHD. Tools like ChatGPT might help a person struggling with related tasks to stay on track, save time, and work within the systems that govern many workplace and interpersonal interactions, but that leaves it far from being a cure-all.\\xa0\"When you think about AI, it's going to help patch up the weaknesses of people in the realms of inattention, lack of focus and organization, and procrastination,\" she said. That could go a long way in clearing a path that allows a person with ADHD's gifts to shine. Honos-Webb emphasized the connection between people with ADHD and creativity, emotional intensity, and sensitivity as one that can be embraced as benefits that balance the struggles with executive function. AI, she noted, cannot really replicate any of these things. As tempting as it is to think of ChatGPT as a path for self-actualizing a chaotic brain, that framework assumes that the most valuable human skills are the ones that AI can augment through structure and lists. But humans are so much more than a tool to be optimized. In addition to medication, I use a growing arsenal of technologies and tactics to manage my ADHD: a Kobo reader for taking and organizing notes, project management tools, and synced calendars to try to stay on track, among others. I could see ChatGPT, or tools like it, becoming a part of that mix, to help people like me complete routine tasks that can become burdensome or overwhelming, and to overcome paralysis by generating starting points for creative thought.However, its middling attempts at replicating some of the things I'm good at, like idea generation and in-depth research, are clumsy at best and problematically inaccurate at worst. Instead, the most helpful thing ChatGPT could do for me is to clear the fog of ADHD paralysis, then step aside and let the human creativity flow.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-ai-and-adhd", "pubDate": "Sun, 16 Apr 2023 09:00:00 +0000"}, {"title": "This discounted game developer bundle comes with a 1-month Xbox Game Pass", "description": "TL;DR: The All-In-One Hardcore Unity Game Developer Bundle is on sale for \\xa320.28, saving you 98% on list price.Gaming, at its core, is all about strategy.

Alternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\\xa0Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.Not the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for April 15.What's the best Wordle starting word?The best Wordle starting word is the one that brings joy to your heart. But if what brings you joy is strategy, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.Is Wordle getting harder?It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:Living in the past.Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?Not today!Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...Today's Wordle starts with the letter D.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Wordle-obsessed?

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a double letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?Q.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?S, B, Q, and F.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.
