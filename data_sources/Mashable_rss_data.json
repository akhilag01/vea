This includes videos with the appearance of candid or secret recordings. If these videos are made outside the Netherlands and there's no documentation of consent, they must be inaccessible within the Netherlands.The decision follows complaints made by the agency Expertise Bureau Online Child Abuse (EOKM), who submitted 10 examples of videos where xHamster didn't obtain proof of consent, Ars Technica reported. These videos were uploaded between 2017 and 2020. Hammy Media argued that since 2021 (following tightened regulations by Mastercard and Visa), only professional producers and verified members can upload content. After a video is uploaded, a moderation team checks the video for illegal content, before it's posted to the public. Proof of identity and consent must be provided for all performers in the video, and checks are made to assure the uploader is the same person as the performer. Despite this, judge RA Dudok van Heel said it's \"sufficiently plausible\" that xHamster can't demonstrate that permission has been obtained for people appearing in a large amount of footage on the site. Hammy Media provided consent documentation for one of the 10 videos EOKM cited, and the judge didn't find that persuasive. Now, xHamster has three weeks after the ruling to remove the videos, or be subject to fines \\u2014 \\u20ac10,000 (around $11,000) per video, which will increase by \\u20ac500 ($550) per day that the video is still public, up to \\u20ac30,000 ($33,000). In a press release, EOKM called this decision a victory. Director of EOKM, Arda Gerkens, stated that they'll consider taking further steps against other porn sites. Otto Volgant of Dutch law firm Boekx Advocaten said this is a historic ruling with major implications in the adult industry, and referenced when Pornhub removed millions of unverified videos.The case raises questions, director of public affairs at the U.S. porn industry lobby group Free Speech Coalition, Mike Stabile, told Mashable. Stabile said that xHamster appears to have one of the more rigorous content verification systems in the industry, and there's no evidence that the site isn't removing non-consensually distributed content when its reported to them.\"So while I understand the concerns, inside the industry and out, there are thousands of sites, adult and non-adult, that host unverified content \\u2014 including sites like Twitter,\" Stabile said. \"No one should have private or copyrighted content distributed without their consent, but I am always concerned when the government specifically targets adult sites for issues that are internet wide.\"xHamster hasn't yet responded to Mashable's request for comment.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/xhamster-amatuer-video-court-ruling-netherlands", "pubDate": "Thu, 13 Apr 2023 18:37:51 +0000"}, {"title": "Elon Musk invests in Twitter AI project after warning about the dangers of AI", "description": "Long before OpenAI's ChatGPT took the internet by storm, Elon Musk was a regular AI critic. But last month the owner of Twitter went as far as to sign an open letter calling for a pause on further AI training due to potential dangers with artificial intelligence.But, while Musk has called for an AI pause, he apparently is going ahead with an AI project of his own.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Elon Musk: My dog is running Twitter now\\n            \\n\\n\\nAccording to a report from Insider, Elon Musk has recently acquired 10,000 GPUs, an investment for a new AI project at Twitter. It's unclear exactly what the AI project is. However, Insider's sources said that Twitter is planning to use its data to train a large language model or LLM and speculated that it could be for updating Twitter's search or ad serving tools.OpenAI has used Twitter's data to train its own language models. However, Musk said in December that he was \"pausing\" OpenAI's access to Twitter's database.Working on large AI models is an intensive, and costly, process. Insider points out that GPUs for AI training made by leading manufacturer Nvidia can cost roughly $10,000, putting Musk's purchase at a likely price tag in the tens of millions of dollars.Musk has been unhappy with OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015 and has since cut ties with the organization. Since ChatGPT became the fastest growing app of all time earlier this year, Musk has hinted at creating his own \"based\" ChatGPT competitor. He's also taken shots at Microsoft, OpenAI's largest partner, which has integrated OpenAI's language models into its Bing search engine. Last month, Musk questioned Microsoft's decision to cut its AI ethics team, even though he laid off Twitter's very own AI ethics team when he took over the company.At Tesla, Musk has been much less gloomy about certain kinds of AI, thanks to the electric car company's need for these technologies in the development of self-driving vehicles. Time will tell if Musk's opinion of AI chatbots shifts as well once he's integrated it into one of his own business models.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-ai-project", "pubDate": "Thu, 13 Apr 2023 18:15:25 +0000"}, {"title": "How 'Succession' helped me grieve the loss of my father", "description": "Just before my dad died last summer, before a two-week hospital stay that was supposed to cure him of a bacterial infection, I had been looking forward to a good old fashioned TV binge-watch.Neil Gaiman's adaptation of his dark mythical masterpiece, The Sandman, was about to drop on Netflix. I'm a huge fan of the graphic novels. But grief for my dad killed my enthusiasm for the show \\u2014 all except for episode 6, which I found myself playing multiple times as a source of solace. \"The Sound of Her Wings\" shows Dream tagging along with his sister, Death: a kinder, gentler grim reaper, warmly empathetic towards the departed even as she departs them.One scene, new for the show, landed like onions in my eyes every time I watched. A man on his honeymoon tries to tell Death he needs one more minute of life, please \\u2014 not for himself, but to give his wife the passcode on his phone, so she can access the plane tickets that will take her home. My dad's health had degraded so swiftly, he hadn't a chance to tell my mother the passcode to his laptop, with all their financial details on it. I managed to hack into the thing while she and my sister planned a funeral that we hoped approximated his unknown wishes.Something about seeing a similar situation play out on screen, even for the length of a scene, was profoundly helpful. We don't often think of visual fiction as part of the treatment for grief, but perhaps we should \\u2014 especially in the wake of the sudden death of \\xfcber-dad Logan Roy in Succession. Oh yes, little did I know last summer when my dad died what was coming down the pike: an hour of parental grief television that would make the tears I shed over \"The Sound of Her Wings\" look like the Hudson river next to the Atlantic.More surprising: This time the emotional roller coaster would not come courtesy of an empathetic grim reaper, but some of the most unlikeable characters on TV. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Remembering Logan Roy: An obituary for 'Succession's CEO and family man\\n            \\n\\n\\nBy now, you probably don't need telling that \"Connor's Wedding\" (what is it with HBO and deaths during weddings?) has been universally hailed as one of the greatest episodes of the year, the decade, possibly all time. I'm hardly alone in feeling it hit home. Anyone who lost a loved one during COVID lockdowns, and had to improvise goodbyes over speakerphones, might find the parallels in this episode too painful to bear. Anyone who has witnessed death on a plane knows that the episode has it right: the crew are legally required to continue performing chest compressions until they land or are too exhausted. And anyone who's ever lost a parent recognizes the reality-collapsing feelings captured here.Despite the fact that this is likely just a pause in the parade of Roy family awfulness \\u2014 Kendall may yet \"go on a killing spree in a 7-Eleven\" and Roman could end up getting his \"dick stuck in an AI jerk machine,\" as Shiv recently predicted \\u2014 our hearts were gutted. But why, exactly? It's not that \"Connor's Wedding\" is the first TV episode to show in excruciating realtime the experience of suddenly losing a parent. It shares a surprising amount of DNA with its distant ancestor, \"The Body,\" a 2001 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in which our hero loses her beloved mom not to a supernatural enemy, but to a brain aneurysm. That episode's use of off-kilter framing and choppy editing to convey Buffy's sense of vertigo, after coming home to find her mom's cold body, was innovative at the time, and still holds up on a rewatch.So what is it that makes us feel like \"Connor's Wedding\" has captured the experience of loss in a bottle like nothing before? Several reviewers, including my former colleague James Poniewozik at the New York Times, have suggested that the characters inhabit the famous stages of grief outlined by psychologist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in 1969: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. I'd amend that, especially considering that the science of grief has moved on from the Kubler-Ross model. (A big part of my grieving process: research.) Rather, it shows how all of those stages smash into each other, messily and with great force, like vast ocean waves, overlapping, pulling us down with the undertow, and the only thing that can save us is to hold on to each other. It is the particular genius of this episode to make the viewer feel this shock of conflicting emotions alongside the characters.Start with the setup, which primes us to expect the continuity of a regular Succession episode. Nothing in last week's trailer, nor the title, nor the cold open, seems out of the ordinary. Logan is up to his old tricks with Roman, testing his most loving son's loyalty by asking him to fire Gerri, the highly competent CEO of his company Waystar Royco. Logan is also planning to fire the head of ATN (read: Fox) News. He flies to Sweden to renegotiate his deal with the tech giant GoJo and is, with casual cruelty, going to miss the wedding of his first son. Each one of these narrative threads could sustain an entire season. We have no idea they are all about to be cut short in episode 3.Yes, Logan had some wistful existential moments in episode 1 of the new series, but in episode 2 he roared like a lion in the offices of ATN, which he was set to run himself once the deal went through. He had big, if vague, plans. Yes, his death was likely to happen by the end of this, the final season of a show that has always been about which of his children would succeed him. The character is 84 years old, and has had a series of health scares going back to his stroke in the very first episode of season 1.But that's the thing about postponing your appointment with Death \\u2014 once you do it a few times, you almost start to seem immortal. Rupert Murdoch, on whose family struggles Succession seems largely based, has literally said that about himself: \"I'm now convinced of my own immortality,\" he declared after beating prostate cancer decades ago. That's according to a shocking new profile in Vanity Fair that calls Murdoch \"a nonagenarian intent on living forever\" \\u2014 despite, or because of, having recently suffered \"a broken back, seizures, two bouts of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and a torn Achilles tendon.\" My family wasn't immune to this kind of magical thinking either. My dad had his first heart attack at 40, a second in his 50s, a stroke at 60, and a cancer that he'd beaten back by 70. His second cancer diagnosis did not look good, but nobody, not even him, expected this mighty oak to be felled by a simple infection prior to chemo.You can see something similar happening over the course of Succession's four seasons. Compare \"Connor's Wedding\" with the second episode of the show, \"Shit Show at the Fuck Factory.\" Post-stroke Logan is in a hospital, on a ventilator, expected to die, with his family already mourning and his executives planning for the worst. But he bounces back from that and other health scares, more full of fury and more manipulative each time. So kids and company are caught flat-footed when Death comes calling in a bathroom at 30,000 ft. \"You're going to be OK because you're a monster and you always win,\" Roman says over the phone to a body that may or may not still have Logan's consciousness in it. At first we the audience are right there with him, in denial. It's almost as if an actor has collapsed on stage in mid-speech. Wait, weren't we watching an episode about a wedding, two firings and a key meeting? Surely they won't derail a plot this massive. It could be a test, right? That would be so Logan, who had just one episode prior had tried to manipulate his kids with an apology of dubious sincerity.Throwing Logan's status into doubt allowed us to see the Roy family raging against the dying of his light \\u2014 something strikingly familiar even if you've only struggled with a sick parent. When Kendall told his assistant Jess to put together a conference call with the world's top experts in fields including \"airplane medicine,\" I couldn't help but remember my own floundering frustration that my dad's cancer care was not being coordinated, or moving swiftly enough, or that he wouldn't take the supplements I'd researched. In a world where we carry connected supercomputers in our pockets, you don't have to have the wealth or connections of the Roys to believe science and technology can stop your loved ones from dying. Or to be furious when they can't. My dad, to be clear, was not Logan. His politics were the polar opposite of Murdochian, his senses of humor and moral justice were vital. He cared deeply about the environment. He was northern English, not Scottish; a local lawyer, not an international businessman; jokingly self-censoring, not sweary as fuck. But he shared a few traits, as well as more than a few sweaters, with the fictional mogul. He was stoic on the surface and gruffly suspicious of many things outside of his world view. He could convey disapproval with a hard stare and a cold silence that I would often, well into my 30s, find myself babbling to fill like I was cousin Greg.Weird thoughts and weird reactions permeate our grief, like Kerry's ridiculously inappropriate smiling. We puncture the tension with dark humor, like Kendall and Roman telling each other \"you are so fucked.\" (Touring quirky woodland burial sites, my sister and I often found ourselves doubled up with laughter at what other inhabitants had written on their gravestones.) We try to conceal our irritation at trite but necessary social statements like \"sorry for your loss.\" (My loss? I often wanted to shoot back. Why isn't it also your loss?)Words become inadequate. Sentences collapse in on themselves. We reach for meaning but it all comes out wrong. The Roys are in the midst of a dozen high-drama plot threads, and now they matter so little their self-interest is just operating on autopilot. Nobody can think of the right thing to say, or even the right way to hug.This, on my successive viewings of \"Connor's Wedding\", seems the most oh-so-real aspect of the script: fragments of dialogue all over the place. The last words of the episode are \"Okay. Okay. So...yeah. Okay.\" Just before that, Shiv begs Tom to tell her what happened, again, from the beginning, and that is one of multiple attempts by the characters to piece it all together. That's what we do with the end of a life we've been watching obsessively. We recap with fellow followers like it's an episode review.Last words, likewise, are often muddied and messy. We'll never know what Logan's were. Before my father died, I'd imagined we would at least have time to say all the words so rarely said in his stoic world. But as it turned out, my last in-person words \\u2014 as I was about to fly back from the UK, days before his infection sent him to the hospital \\u2014 were \"I'll be back.\" \"Arnie said that,\" he smiled. \"And he was!\" Roman could have been with Logan on the plane had he abandoned his duty to his brother. I could have simply stayed with my dad had I abandoned my duties in the U.S. I'll never stop regretting that I didn't. His last text exchange with me was ten days later. The only part I'm sure he saw and understood was as follows:\"Blood pressure and oxygen level were low but now stable.\" \\u2029\"Texting levels also stable! Are they keeping you in?\"\"Probably.\"It may not have the drama of Roman anguishing over whether the last words of his that his father heard were \"are you a cunt?\" But I felt it hard when, minutes later, Roman slumped to the ground, recapping everything he'd babbled into the phone, and said, \"I think I said I love him, right?\"Fact check: He had not. Take it from me, Roman: You will have to get comfortable begging Death, every day you have left, for just one more minute of time with the complicated, beloved departed.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/succession-grief", "pubDate": "Thu, 13 Apr 2023 18:08:42 +0000"}, {"title": "Clean house with your pick of these discounted Shark vacuums", "description": "Save big on Shark home appliances as of April 13, including upright vacuums, robot vacuums and mops, and more.

New users can sign up for a 27-month Standard plan at the introductory rate of just $3.29/month (billed $88.83 upfront), which is 75% off its usual $12.99/month pricing and protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Debuting Thursday, the campaign leverages Amazon's vast music library of over 100 million songs and a new interactive tool that pairs key emotions with corresponding tracks, many of them recognizable hits like Coldplay's \"Fix You,\" Billie Eilish's \"Lovely,\" and Selena Gomez's \"Me and My Mind.\" Parents who notice that their child is struggling but can't quite break through typical teen resistance to exploring their feelings through conversation might use the interactive tool to search for and share an appropriate song, with a simple prompt like, \"Talk later?\" or \"Everyone can feel sad sometimes.\" The tool is available in both English and Spanish. A two-minute film that accompanies the campaign features a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter navigating tough emotions and using the interactive tool. \"Our goal is to help parents and caregivers support their kids' emotional well-being, especially through those turbulent preteen and teen years. This new tool from Amazon will open up the conversation for families through one of the most powerful emotional associations we have: music,\" Heidi Arthur, chief campaign development officer of the Ad Council, told Mashable in a statement. \"We know this digital experience will help spark some powerful and important talks.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How to ask a teen if they're feeling suicidal\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe interactive tool is the latest effort by the Ad Council's Sound It Out campaign to help parents and caregivers talk to teens about their feelings and mental health. Additionally, the Seize the Awkward campaign, which launched in 2018, is designed to help teens and young adults learn how to ask friends about their well-being. The new tool comes in the wake of heightened emotional and mental health distress amongst teens. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that, in 2021, teen girls experienced record levels of sexual violence and sadness, and that three quarters of LGBQ+ teens expressed persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, with nearly one in four LGBQ+ teens reporting a suicide attempt.When parents use Sound It Out's interactive tool, they can search for emotions like afraid, confused, inspired, heartbroken, and happy. Those emotions will yield song matches like \"Breathin\" by Ariana Grande, \"Ordinary People\" by John Legend, \"Girl on Fire\" by Alicia Keys, \"Call Out My Name\" by The Weeknd, and \"Good Feeling\" by Flo Rida. Once parents know which song they'd like to send, they can ask Alexa through an Echo device or the free Alexa app to share it with their teen, who will receive a notification within the app. The teen can listen to the song at their convenience, and the song can then be played on any Alexa-enabled device on Amazon Music's free, Prime, or Unlimited plans. Alexa must be enabled to use the tool. Amazon is not collecting personal user data on the campaign's landing page, which includes the interactive tool. In addition to the interactive tool, the campaign has a website dedicated to helping parents and caregivers start meaningful conversations about emotional well-being with their teens. A \"conversation starter pack\" offers prompts to help parents and teens talk about subjects like their favorite musical artist, who they consider their closest friends and family members, and what's been making them sad or happy lately. A separate guide to emotions offers basic information for topics including sadness, sexuality, racism, and grief, and offers suggestions for starting related conversations with a teen. \"The Ad Council\\u2019s initiative to create open, accepting, and proactive discussions around mental health resonates with our goals to do better and be better for our customers, employees, and communities,\" Alan Moss, vice president of Global Advertising Sales at Amazon, said in a statement. \"Music has always been a vehicle for connection, and\\xa0'Sound It Out: When You Can't Say It, Play It' provides parents and caregivers with another tool to check in with their teens.\"If you're feeling suicidal or experiencing a mental health crisis, please talk to somebody.

One of the most talked about moments at the heavily documented event was playfully dubbed \"spitgate,\" referring to the moment Harry Styles appeared to spit on his co-star Chris Pine as he was taking his seat in the theater. Pine has since stated that Styles \"did not spit on me,\" but that hasn't stopped the internet thirsting over the idea. Spitting seems to be becoming somewhat of a theme in pop culture. Several recent film and television examples include Ted Lasso, Dune, and Succession, each featuring spitting in some form. Additionally, spitting is all over TikTok, with hashtags like #spittok (186.9 million views), #spit (488.2 million views), and #spitqueen (2 million views).\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            KinkTok is rife with misinformation.

People are horny as hell for spit.Having a spit kinks means that you get an erotic charge from being spat on or spitting on someone. Getting spit on is widely accepted as being one the most horrific, degrading things someone could do to another person IRL. But in sex, it can be sought after, craved, and a part of play. Sarah Melancon, PhD, a sociologist, clinical sexologist, and resident expert at The Sex Toy Collective, a one-stop hub for all things sex toys, points out that porn site Clips4Sale\\u2019s spit fetish category contains over 1.1 million clips. This gives us a sense of this kink\\u2019s popularity.What\\u2019s more, being horned up for spit can go beyond the physical act of spitting and manifest as a focus on saliva. This can be done for bonding, intimacy, and even sensation play. Sex is so weird and we love it.Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.So, what\\u2019s the deal with spit kinks? Why are we into them and how can we indulge in them? Let\\u2019s dig in.What is a spit kink?What is a spit kink, you ask? Well, it\\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: Being into spit, in a sexual way. \"Spit play, or spit kink, involves the use of saliva during sexual activity,\" says Kenneth Play, an international educator and author of Beyond Satisfied: A Sex Hacker\\u2019s Guide to Endless Orgasms, Mind-Blowing Connection, and Lasting Confidence. \"This can include spitting on one's partner, swapping saliva through kissing, or incorporating saliva into other sexual acts.\"That\\u2019s right, folx. Sexy spit. We hope the mental images are already pouring in with wild abandon.Dr. Nazanin Moali, a psychologist, sex therapist, and the host of the Sexology podcast, adds that spit kinks can involve saliva swapping in many different forms, but usually manifest as one partner consensually spitting on the other without \"specific limitations on the targeted body part.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            A beginner's guide to understanding Dom/sub dynamics\\n            \\n\\n\\nSpit kinks fall under the BDSM umbrella and often involve some level of humiliation play, though this isn\\u2019t always the case. The Dom may spit on the sub for many reasons including bonding, humiliation, an interest in bodily fluids, and more. Like all things in sex, spit kinks can be played out in a million different ways and the ways people engage with them will depend on what they want out of the scene.\\xa0How to practice spit-play in a safe and consensual way.If you want to get down with a spit kink, there are some things you should keep in mind so that your play is done in an ethical way. Here are the three golden rules.Consent.\\xa0If you\\u2019re going to spit on someone or have them spit on you, you need 100 percent, enthusiastic consent. \"While many people love saliva, others find it a complete turn-off.\\xa0 Always discuss your turn ons and offs with a partner before trying [anything],\" Melancon says. Figuring out how you want to play with this kink before you try it is very important. We all have limits.\\n    Firstly, you want to be sure everyone is on board with spitting before spitting happens. \\n    \\nCommunicate.Firstly, you want to be sure everyone is on board with spitting before spitting happens. Spitting on someone without asking is a violation of their consent. Make sure everyone is down to go to Saliva Town. Boundaries with kink play need to be discussed before the play happens so everyone is on board and feels safe.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Why we enjoy being humiliated during sex\\n            \\n\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re playing with spit and someone is not having it or decides it isn\\u2019t working for them at that moment, you both need to be able to communicate with each other. Having a safe word can be really beneficial here. This is a non-sexual word designed to let a partner know that a boundary has been reached.\\xa0Be careful with your health.\\xa0While saliva is generally safe as far as STIs go, you could still pass on viral infections \\u2014 like a cold or COVID. If you or your partner are feeling unwell, keep spit play on the back burner until you\\u2019re back to 100 percent.You might be wondering about oral Herpes or HS1V. You can\\u2019t get oral herpes through spit. It\\u2019s \\u200b\\u200bspread through skin-on-skin so you should be safe. Now, since oral herpes is spread by skin-to-skin, if someone has an active cold sore, take precautions \\u2014 like avoiding oral sex and kissing.\\xa0Why people are so into spit during sex.People find a lot of things attractive about spit during sex. \"By incorporating this once-taboo act into their intimate moments, individuals can explore boundaries and add an element of thrill to their experiences, further enhancing the attraction of this kink for those who engage in it,\" Moali says.So, let\\u2019s break down some of the reasons people want to get wet and wild.Consensual D/s playBeing into spit is inherently kinky because kink is anything that falls outside the realm of vanilla sex. We can safely say spitting on someone falls outside of these parameters. Spit kinks can be a part of a bigger Dominant/submissive role play. The act of spitting on a sub can be a form of erotic humiliation and/or a way to create a deeper bond between the Dom/sub. Moali says spitting works so well in these scenes because it \"can serve as a powerful symbol of authority.\"Intimacy with saliva\\xa0Swapping spit can also be a way to create intimacy. \"Saliva play such as spitting in each other\\u2019s mouths may feel intimate, sharing something that is typically kept private,\" Melancon says.Being into bodily fluidsPeople are turned on by my bodily fluids because we\\u2019re able to eroticize basically anything. Some bodily fluid kinds might manifest as being turned on by blood, piss play, sweat, and yes, spit. Melancon tells us that while in a general sense we tend to view bodily fluids as unappealing (and maybe even gross), \"when sexually aroused, our threshold for disgust increases and we may happily engage in behaviors we would find disgusting in other contexts.\" Studies support this.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            What is piss play, the fetish in the new season of 'You'?\\n            \\n\\n\\nBeing into wet and messiness during sexSpit can also be a part of \"wet and messy\" fetishes. These include things like food play and sploshing \\u2026 and spit! \"Those who enjoy rubbing saliva on themselves, seeing a partner covered in spit, or extra sloppy kisses or blow jobs may fall in this category,\" says Melancon.Just \\u2026 enjoying the sensation!People might also be into saliva and/or spitting because they enjoy the sensation. Play tells us that you might just like the feeling of spit on your skin, the sound of someone spitting, or the way it feels. Basically, spit kinks can be a form of sensation play (which we\\u2019ve written about extensively, just for you).\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            A beginner's guide to sensation play\\n            \\n\\n\\nIs it normal to spit?While there are a whopping ZERO studies on spit kinks (boring), these kinks are quite common. According to research from his book, Tell Me What You Want, Dr. Justin Lehmiller found that roughly nine percent of participants reported engaging in spitting or being spat on during sexual activity. Play says that this kink is not exactly in the mainstream per se, but it\\u2019s definitely something people are into. It\\u2019s totally normal to have a spit kink. So, if you\\u2019re worried about it, don\\u2019t be.\\xa0\\n    Sexual expression is so hugely varied that there is no simple way to pin it down. \\n    \\nMoali says \"spitgate\" might \"have sparked increased discussion surrounding this kink,\" she says. \"This heightened awareness has piqued curiosity for some, leading them to realize the potential appeal of spit play, and prompting them to explore whether it aligns with their personal interests.\"Sexual expression is so hugely varied that there is no simple way to pin it down. People are into what they\\u2019re into. And we should be more chill about that. If you\\u2019re out here asking your partner to spit in your mouth, that\\u2019s totally fine. Be safe, communicate, and allow yourself to get off on the things that you like. Life\\u2019s too short for shame.\\xa0", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/spit-kink-sex-explained", "pubDate": "Thu, 13 Apr 2023 11:47:31 +0000"}, {"title": "Watch Nicholas Hoult surprise call Nicolas Cage in the middle of the night on live radio", "description": "You know it's a powerful radio moment when the host is literally lost for words at the end.That's what happens in the BBC Radio 1 clip above when guest Nicholas Hoult plays \"Sitting or Standing?\" with DJ Greg James, a game that basically involves calling random famous people in the guest's contacts and asking them if they're sitting down or standing up.Nicolas Cage's response? \"Well I'm actually lying down, it's so early in the morning.\"Hoult apologises, after which Cage tells him not to worry. \"That's alright, I was up anyway,\" he says. \"I was just surfing some net.\"Iconic.", "link": "https://mashable.com/video/nicholas-hoult-surprise-calls-nicolas-cage-bbc-radio-1", "pubDate": "Thu, 13 Apr 2023 10:58:35 +0000"}, {"title": "Twitter to let users buy stocks and crypto via eToro", "description": "Need yet another place to buy and sell stocks and cryptocurrencies?

Cast members Lili Reinhart, Camila Mendes, KJ Apa, Madelaine Petsch, and Cole Sprouse have basically become household names, and now, with the start of the show's seventh season, they're officially saying goodbye to the Town With Pep. Alas, it's the end of an era.If you want to find out how things end for Archie and his friends in Riverdale Season 7, you'll have plenty of ways to tune in. Here's what you need to know.How many seasons of Riverdale are there?Riverdale premiered in January 2017 on The CW, and just kicked off its seventh season. While many fans are torn about whether the show has overstayed its welcome, the CW\\u2019s CEO Mark Pedowitz told Deadline, \"We want to make sure it goes out the right way.\\u201dIs the 7th season of Riverdale the last?In March 2022, Riverdale was renewed for a seventh season. It was also announced that the seventh season would officially be the end of the subversive Archie Comics-based series. Season 7 premiered on March 29, 2023, and the series finale is set to air on August 23, 2023. The core cast has already started diving into other acting roles to expand their repertoire.\\n\\n\\nHow many episodes are in Season 7 of Riverdale?The seventh and final season of Riverdale will consist of 20 episodes, released weekly on the CW. With exception of the pilot season, every season of the show has had between 19 and 22 episodes, so we expect the final season to follow a similar format.How to watch Riverdale Season 7 for freeNew episodes of Riverdale Season 7 hit the CW every Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. If you're a stickler for watching new episodes live, you'll need a cable subscription or a live TV subscription like FuboTV, Hulu + Live TV, or YouTube TV. Of course, all of these options come with a price tag. If you don't mind waiting until the next day to watch new episodes of Riverdale, you have a few different routes for streaming \\u2014\\xa0including a free one. The CW app and website both add new episodes the day after they air on live TV. The CW app requires no subscription or login \\u2014\\xa0it's always free. There are just a couple of qualms. First, the free collection only includes the five most recent episodes throughout the season. So, you'll have to be extremely strategic with your watch schedule. Second, you'll have to sit through ad breaks with no options for skipping. Hey, what do you expect when you get to watch for free?One of our favorite workarounds for those issues, however, is a handy VPN. Riverdale Season 7 premieres on UK Netflix and Canadian Netflix the day after the live episodes air on TV in the U.S. Netflix doesn't limit the episode selection, so you can watch at your own leisure. And with the right subscription, you won't have to sit through annoying ads. Win-win. Of course, you'll have to subscribe to a VPN and connect to a server in the UK or Canada in order to access the content \\u2014\\xa0and VPNs usually require a paid subscription. Fortunately, we've got you covered with the best deals.The best live TV deals for watching Riverdale Season 7 live on the CWLove hosting live watch parties or knowing what happened in a new episode before everyone else?

It was a complete turn of events for me, as someone who had been pursuing a career as a psychodynamic therapist, and I was so proud to begin sharing my progress on social media.\\xa0\\xa0As I detailed my journey online, I recognized a sense of community building as people began following me, someone with whom they identified \\u2014 a Black, queer, and neurodivergent woman \\u2014 in a field where that\\u2019s rare. Black women only make up 0.7 percent of the technology workforce in the UK, with even fewer also identifying as neurodivergent and/or queer.\\xa0My goal is to inspire and empower those who identify with any or all areas of my intersectionality to get into the tech industry, and to do so, I use the most powerful and accessible tools at my disposal: my voice, my story, and social media.\\xa0Sharing my intersectionalityAs a DevOps engineer, multi-award-winning neurodiversity and inclusion advocate, writer, public speaker, and the founder of The Opal Company, I use my platforms to promote education on topics related to neurodiversity, inclusion, and tech, including understanding intersectionality.\\xa0A term coined by civil rights advocate Kimberl\\xe9 Crenshaw, intersectionality describes the complex, cumulative way the effects of multiple forms of discrimination overlap and impact marginalized individuals. In creating an amalgam of identities that is more than the sum of their parts, intersectionality shapes perception \\u2014 how you experience the world, judgments held against you, and how you influence others.Throughout my life, I have always been reminded of my Blackness, even more so upon entering the tech industry. When I moved from London to Belfast for my first technical role, as a junior software engineer, I was so excited. But, after a week or two in my new position \\u2014\\xa0working with about 500 people at the head office of one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United Kingdom \\u2014 I came to the realization I was the only Black woman there. Suddenly, the stares when I walked into the cafeteria made sense, and I began choosing to eat on my own.\\xa0Although I was always honest and open about feeling misunderstood, I saw no changes in the company's diversity and inclusion practices. I am grateful for the individuals I did connect with \\u2014 some of whom I still consider friends \\u2014 but it can be exhausting and isolating to constantly feel responsible for teaching others about your identity and providing inspiration through representation. I tried to reassure myself that what I was sharing would contribute to a better experience for the next person who joined the company and looked like me.However, the loneliness took a toll on me mentally, and I became miserable and unmotivated. Eventually, I found myself in the throes of extreme anxiety while on a Zoom call in 2021, rocking from side to side with my camera off as I tried to maintain composure. I was referred to a mental health professional for cognitive behavioral therapy and diagnosed with anxiety, which followed diagnoses of dyslexia, dyspraxia, and ADHD three years prior.\\xa0This journey eventually led me to being diagnosed as autistic just last month, coincidentally during World Autism Acceptance Week. Although I do have sadness that it took so long to identify this new area of my identity, it\\u2019s one I accept, celebrate, and am learning to embrace.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nBeing neurodivergent can bring gifts such as creativity, unique ways of thinking, and a desire to learn new subjects. It also can present challenges that often make it hard to explain what I need, and it hasn\\u2019t been easy progressing in my technology career in environments not designed for a neurodiverse workforce. I use a variety of accommodations, including medication and screen readers, to help me navigate my day-to-day life in and out of the workplace.\\xa0But, following my own path, I have earned multiple awards and honors, in addition to being featured in several publications, giving keynote speeches, participating on expert panels, and even co-authoring a book called The Voices in the Shadow about Black women in tech. Most recently, I\\u2019ve been selected to serve as a United Nations Women UK delegate on the Commission on the Status of Women. 'You can't be what you can't see.'In a world with an abundance of opinions on the many layers of my identity, I\\u2019ve come to embrace that there will be people who don't want to hear my story \\u2014 but there are about 30,000 others following me online, contributing to opportunities to learn and grow, and inspiring me to continue sharing my authentic self.\\xa0Ultimately, the amount of followers doesn't matter, and the amount of views doesn't matter \\u2014 it\\u2019s the communities that my story does touch that matter the most.Activist Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children\\u2019s Defense Fund, said, \"You can't be what you can't see.\" Being neurodivergent, being queer, being a Black woman, and even being a DevOps engineer means I can be for others what I couldn't see for myself.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"I love how well you've embraced your identity, giving voices to it and by so doing, allowing others to embrace their true identity.\" \"Stand in your power and keep moving mountains.\" Comments like these replies to a recent post I shared on LinkedIn about being diagnosed with autism as an adult show the sense of mutual support and purpose that drives me to continue to push for awareness and inclusion.Building a social media presence and publicly sharing yourself with the world can be challenging, especially for those who are part of marginalized communities. However, it can be empowering \\u2014 not just for you, but for those who may be motivated through your example.\\xa0Protecting your digital spaceAs a technologist who is a part of many marginalized identities, protecting the space I\\u2019ve claimed in my industry and on social media is critical to my achievement and my well-being \\u2014 a foundational piece of being able to share my story. Although it may seem simple to some, I\\u2019ve worked to become comfortable trusting my intuition online and blocking people when it feels right. As someone who genuinely enjoys discussing advice on getting into the tech industry, learning to code, or simply existing as a Black, queer, neurodivergent woman in the corporate world, I want to share myself freely but have been met with disrespect by those exhibiting a sense of entitlement to that degree of access.\\xa0Although I have a tendency to exhibit hyperfocus in scenarios of conflict or rudeness, I\\u2019ve grown to recognize the answer is in trusting how I feel. Instead of struggling with guilt for not offering the world the big heart my culture and society expect from me, I choose to prioritize my own well-being, and that allows me to continue excelling at doing what I love as a software engineer and as an advocate.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Jermaine L. Murray is 'The Jobfather' growing diversity in tech\\n            \\n\\n\\nAlthough it can be overwhelming, social media plays a huge part in building your brand, establishing yourself as an expert in your field, and developing a network of support. Protecting your mental and emotional wellness and sense of self is just as important a part of managing your social media as any other, and I employ fundamental strategies to safeguard my space online:\\xa0Create a Safe Social EnvironmentDon't feel blameworthy for not responding to people. I used to feel guilty for not replying to a comment or a question quickly enough, at times due to my followers telling me I deserved to feel that way. As a Black woman, and even in my role as an eldest daughter, I had gotten used to always feeling obligated to be available to others at the detriment of myself. But it's important to always put yourself first. Block Hurtful People and Don't RespondI've blocked so many people over the years who have been sexist, racist, misogynistic, or just plain rude. At times, I felt guilty, but you never should. We can only keep the door open for those who respect it and close the door for those who don't.Take BreaksAs a neurodivergent person, I can get overwhelmed very easily. It's in moments like these when I choose to step away from social media. You don't need to announce the social media break; you can just uninstall the apps and breathe.Be Mindful of What You ShareDon't feel obligated to share everything about your life, location, or opinions. Your entire life does not need to be content. You can keep things to yourself. Setting boundaries is important to both your mental health and your safety. Make conscious choices about who has access to anything showing your home, and be sure to save content created while traveling for posting once you've returned safely. Also, use tools like two-factor authentication and strong password practices to secure your social media accounts and maintain control over what is shared on your behalf. Anyone can be susceptible to being hacked, but these safeguards can help protect your digital presence. Offering inspiration through authenticityAs I find new connections and community through my recent autism diagnosis, I encourage you to keep sharing your story and inspiring people in your corner of the internet \\u2014 it makes a difference to more people than you may think. Remember, the number of followers you have or don\\u2019t have doesn't determine your impact; what is essential is remaining authentic and true to who you are as you welcome the world into your life online.For those who can identify with any area of my intersectionality, I hope my experience encourages you to be unapologetic about who you are, and to come as you are in every space you enter.Want more perspectives from thought leaders in tech delivered to your inbox?

It's Thursday, tomorrow is Friday, and after that, glorious weekend time. To pass the long hours, let's tackle yet another Wordle! We're here as always to help guide the way with our expert Wordle advice and the solution.If you prefer to just be told the answer, you can scroll to the end of this article for April 13's Wordle solution to be revealed. But if you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.Where did Wordle come from?Originally created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, Wordle rapidly spread to become an international phenomenon, with thousands of people around the globe playing every day. Alternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\\xa0Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.Not the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for April 12.What's the best Wordle starting word?The best Wordle starting word is the one that brings joy to your heart. But if what brings you joy is strategy, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.Is Wordle getting harder?It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:Worth its weight in gold.Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?It does! But they're not consecutive.Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...Today's Wordle starts with the letter C.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Wordle-obsessed?

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a twice-occurring letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?X.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?D, P, M, and C.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

Reddit now?", "description": "Artifact, the significantly less addictive app brought to you by the creators of Instagram, was originally pitched essentially as a TikTok For You page, but for news. But after launching its brand new social discussions feature, which rolled out on April 11, it looks a lot more like Reddit.The app launched in February and intended to merge articles, facts, and AI. One of the creators, Mike Krieger, called it \"a personalized news feed driven by the latest in artificial intelligence.\" You could always DM people from the app, but it didn't really invoke a lot of community-forming emotions. For the first few weeks of its existence, using the platform felt a lot like using Pocket or Apple News but, honestly, worse. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Instagram gets two new types of ads, yay\\n            \\n\\n\\nNow, users can create profiles, comment on articles, upvote and downvote (hi Reddit), and earn a \"reputation\" (not Taylors Version). It seems like these new features \\u2014 particularly the comment abilities \\u2014 could help make Artifact a social media app instead of just a news platform. The new social discussions component on Artifact will allow users to comment on articles and engage in conversation around news, according to TechCrunch. Users can't comment on the articles without creating a profile \\u2014 which requires a phone number and includes a display name \\u2014 Artifact confirmed to Mashable.While this might make Artifact more interesting for users, it's also opening a Pandora's box of moderation issues which will be mitigated by \"reputation scores\" based on upvotes and downvotes on comments, similar to Reddit's voting system, TechCrunch reported. That \"reputation score\" will display next to users' names and profiles, and will help determine how comments are ranked. Artifact is also relying on community flagging to help with moderation, and is \"using AI models to proactively scan for problematic content\" that doesn't follow community guidelines, Artifact told Mashable in an email. But those models simply flag the content to be reviewed by their human team.While these additions might make the platform more intriguing to the everyday user, it's tough to imagine an app all about reading the news that beats the mind-numbing joy (and pain, and fear, and anger...) that we get from Instagram and TikTok.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/artifact-reddit-discussions", "pubDate": "Wed, 12 Apr 2023 21:49:46 +0000"}, {"title": "Everything you need to know about HBO Max becoming Max", "description": "After a merger that led to the shelving of several projects \\u2014 including Batgirl \\u2014 Warner Bros.

Rather than focusing on cleaner tailpipe emissions from fossil fuel-burning cars, the central thrust of this proposal will be on reducing emissions by keeping such vehicles off the road altogether. For instance, if the rules go into effect, 67 percent of car sales would be electric vehicles by 2031, according to EPA projections.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Volkswagen makes huge bet on electric vehicles\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nThe EV industry is already growing fast.

The auto industry is already trending green, but these new standards just set the pace of EV adoption even faster. For the average consumer, that means car options will soon be mostly electric.The Agency estimates that the new standards could save 50 billion tons of carbon emissions by 2055. The proposed emission standards aren't just about clean air though. It would wean the U.S. off of foreign oil dependency \"by approximately 20 billion barrels.\" The EPA also notes that drivers could save an estimated $12,000 in fuel and maintenance costs by switching to an EV. The proposals will be published in Federal Register on April 13, which will make them available for public comment.

The move came after Twitter (which you may have heard is now under the stewardship of Elon Musk) unexpectedly added a \"government-funded media\" label to NPR's Twitter page last week. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Elon Musk: My dog is running Twitter now\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nIn a statement, NPR CEO John Lansing said Twitter unfairly accused NPR of not having editorial independence with the label.\"Millions of Americans depend on NPR and their local public radio stations for the fact-based, independent, public service journalism they need to stay informed about the world and about their own communities. They depend on your work, the rigorous reporting they need to exercise their rights as citizens and the music and entertainment that brings them moments of joy. It would be a disservice to the serious work you all do here to continue to share it on a platform that is associating the federal charter for public media with an abandoning of editorial independence or standards.\"It's easy to understand why NPR would abandon Twitter because of this. The label, which originally read \"state-affiliated media\" before being changed over the weekend, is not accurate. Only one percent of NPR's annual budget comes from the government, per NPR itself. From NPR's perspective, that label can only erode public trust in the institution by associating it with news organizations that might publish unconcealed propaganda.This could be a unique one-off situation, but don't be shocked if, over time, more and more news outlets abandon Twitter like this.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/npr-leaves-twitter-elon-musk", "pubDate": "Wed, 12 Apr 2023 17:03:48 +0000"}, {"title": "Lots of self-emptying robot vacuums are on sale for under $500 just in time for spring cleaning", "description": "\\nUPDATE: Apr. 13, 2023, 5:00 a.m. EDT This story has been updated to include the best deals on robot vacuums from iRobot, eufy, and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n        Our top picks this week:\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    Best budget deal\\n                \\n\\nEufy 30C\\n                        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\u2014 $179.99\\n$279.99\\n(save $100)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    Best self-emptying deal\\n                \\n\\niRobot Roomba i1+\\n                        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\u2014 $264.90\\n$469\\n(save $204.10)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    Best vacuum-mop combo\\n                \\n\\nRoborock Q7 Max\\n                        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\u2014 $399.99\\n$599.99\\n(save $200 wiith on-page coupon)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly three things are certain in life: Death, taxes, and a few days each month when you need to vacuum but just don't have time.

Suction power is typically measured in Pascals (Pa), with most current vacs ranging between 1,500 Pa and 3,000 Pa. Stronger sucking will be needed to pick up heavier pieces of debris (be sure to set a no-go zone around Legos) and to pull matted-down pet hair from rugs.Know your floor typeCarpeting and high pile rugs\\xa0will probably require stronger suction than hard floors, as well as special features like an extra-wide or self-cleaning brush roll to prevent hair from wrapping and clogging. Folks in homes with multiple floor types might consider a bigger, sturdier robot vacuum that can hurl itself and its wheels over mats, rugs, and transitions from carpet to hard floors.Consider automatic emptyingBecause robot vacuums are typically under four inches tall, their onboard dust bins are also small \\u2014 which means they frequently require emptying. (Dustbins fill up particularly quickly in homes with pets.) A self-emptying vacuum takes that job out of your hands, emptying itself into a larger dustbin in its charging dock. These larger bins can typically hold weeks of dirt without needing to be cleaned or dumped out.Think about your home's layoutEvery robot vacuum is equipped with sensors and drop detection. But if your home has lots of rooms, lots of turns, or lots of close-together furniture, you'll have fewer navigation issues with an advanced model that uses intelligent mapping to remember exactly how your home is laid out, including labeling of specific rooms, mental notes of staircases, and ability to deploy zone cleaning.Pay attention to low-profile furnitureNo one should have to be scared about what's accumulated under their couch over the past year. A robot vacuum measuring three inches or less in height should be able to scoot under most low-hanging couches and beds.Assess battery life and square footageOne of the main complaints people have about their robot vacuum is that it craps out in the middle of the floor. Larger spaces require more time to clean, and it all depends on how annoyed you'll be if it only finishes a few rooms at a time. Average run times for the list below range between 90 and 200 minutes, which translates to about 500 and 2,800 square feet covered on one charge.Look for app controlWiFi-enabled robot vacuums can be synced with a smartphone app to control scheduling, manual start, and cleaning settings, as well as telling your vac to make its rounds when you're not home. Low-end models that don't connect to WiFi will usually come with a separate remote. If you're used to asking Alexa or Google to turn off the lights or tell you the weather, a model with voice integration will blend in nicely.", "link": "https://mashable.com/deals/best-robot-vacuum-deals", "pubDate": "Wed, 12 Apr 2023 17:03:46 +0000"}, {"title": "Ariana Grande calls for an end to public body scrutiny", "description": "Ariana Grande's taken notice of the incessant online commenters remarking on her body, and she's had enough.Posting to her TikTok account on Tuesday, the singer and actor asked people online to be more careful with their words, to acknowledge that health and beauty manifests itself in a myriad of ways, and to stop talking about people's appearances \\u2014 full stop. \"I just wanted to address your concerns about my body, and talk a little bit about what it means to be a person with a body, and to be seen, and to be paid such close attention to,\" Grande said, addressing her 31 million followers. \"I think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people's bodies, no matter what. If you think you're saying something good or well-intentioned... There are ways to compliment someone, or to ignore something you see that you don't like, that I think we should help each other work towards,\" she said. \"There are many different ways to look healthy and beautiful.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Rutgers University strike brings education to the picket line\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe star \\u2014 who currently is shooting a movie adaptation of Wicked \\u2014 also said people online should aim to keep each other \"safe\" by refraining from comments like these, and that online personas often don't convey the full extent of someone's life and health status.Grande is just the latest celebrity amid a chorus of voices speaking directly about this type of digital discourse. In February, actor and Rare Beauty founder Selena Gomez made a similar appeal to online commenters via a TikTok Live, after yet another wave of chatter about the size of her body disregarded her chronic illness. \"I would much rather be healthy and take care of myself and my medications are important and I believe they are what helps me. So, yeah, not a model, never will be,\" she said. Gomez is now the most followed woman on Instagram, with more than 400 million eyes on every post. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nIn January, Grammy-winning artist Lizzo also admonished the \"tired\" nature of body discourse on her TikTok. \"I have seen comments go from \\u2018Oh my gosh, I liked you when you were thick. Why did you lose weight?\\u2019 to \\u2018Oh my gosh, why did you get a BBL? I liked your body before.\\u2019 to \\u2018Oh my gosh, you\\u2019re so big,'\" she said. \\u201cDo you see the delusion? Do we realize that artists are not here to fit into your beauty standards?\\u201d The list goes on: Florence Pugh, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift. In their statements, Grande and others have alluded to two different modes of thinking among health professionals and activists, known as body positivity and body neutrality. Body positivity, a now widely-used term by individuals and brands alike, prioritizes the notion of diverse beauty and self-love. Body neutrality, on the other hand, advocates for removing any moral worth towards physical appearances, and de-emphasizing beauty or desire in favor of acceptance. Some online pose that body positivity has lost its might as brands and ill-informed celebs have co-opted the phrase, pushing for neutrality as the default response in ways similar to Grande's initial point. Others think it actually needs to go further and advocate for radical fat liberation.TikTok has become a central gathering space for those navigating these various forms of body acceptance, as well as an organizing tool among those trying to redefine the way we all talk about fitness, health, beauty, and diversity. Last year, TikTok creator Elyse Meyers went viral for her story about negative childhood body image spurred by unsolicited comments from adults in her life, begging us all to do better now. Diverse, body-positive creators are gaining more prominence in the app's fashion and fitness spaces. Younger generations on the platform are both learning from, and repeating the mistakes of those past. Meanwhile, the internet and fandom at large are experiencing a growing problem of parasocial relationships and nonconsensual \"thirsting\", which put celebrities at the center of boundary-less, unsolicited conversations about sexual attraction and beauty. Throughout it all, real people sit behind the social media profiles, magazine covers, and popular media that dominate our lives and gather the brunt of internet discourse, long before we've figured out its consequences. \"You never know what somebody's going through,\" Grande said in her post. \"I was...at the lowest point of my life when I looked the way you consider my healthy, but that, in fact, wasn't my healthy. I know I shouldn't have to explain that, but I do feel like maybe having an openness and some sort of vulnerability here...something good might come from it.\" Want more Social Good stories in your inbox?

You could tune into the MLB, but the season is a much more drawn out commitment. For something a bit different, yet still full of passion and excitement, check out the Indian Premier League (IPL) \\u2014\\xa0the world's most lucrative cricket league. The IPL is back for its 16th season in 2023 and both cricket fanatics and newbies in the US have a couple options for streaming every single match. What is the Indian Premier League?Established in 2008, the Indian Premier League \\u2014\\xa0known as the IPL \\u2014\\xa0is a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league. Unlike the MLB or similar US-based sports leagues, it operates on a simple round-robin group and knockout format. Each of the eight teams play each other home and away, accumulating two points for wins, one point for ties, and zero points for losses. After the double round-robin, the bottom four teams are eliminate and the top four go to the playoff series.When does the IPL 2023 season start?The IPL 2023 season kicked off on March 31 with the Gujarat Titans hosting the Chennai Super Kings in Ahmedabad. The regular season lasts just 52 match days and concludes on May 21, followed by the playoffs and the final match taking place on May 28.The 16th season is the first full-fledged IPL season since 2019, thanks to COVID-19 disruptions.

Fortunately, there's a work around for US-based fans.You can access global streaming platforms from anywhere in the world with a VPN. Of course, some VPNs are better than others (more on that later), but with the right one, you can seamlessly stream every electric IPL match for free on JioCinema.

So, technically, you won't be streaming the matches completely free. They do, however, tend to offer money-back guarantees, free trials, and discounted subscriptions.What is the best VPN for streaming IPL matches?ExpressVPN: Save 49% on a 15-month planMashable contributor Branford Shaw tested ExpressVPN and found it to be an excellent all-rounder, noting that it's \"easy to use, it works well, and there's amble support available whenever you need it.\" It's our top pick for those reasons, plus its 3,000+ servers around the globe, which allow you to connect to the web via India.

Check our initial impressions of the Lamborghini Revuelto here.Buying a supercar. What's it really like?For the uninitiated, it may sound something the super-rich do on a whim. In reality, however, it often involves a lot of careful planning and obsessing over every detail of your new, ultra pricy, ultra lightweight, ultra fast plaything. And then you have to wait until it arrives, sometimes for years. On the manufacturer's side, producing the car requires spending a lot of human work hours, with highly skilled laborers making sure every detail of the car's interior and exterior is perfect, and tuned to the future owner's desires.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Lamborghini Revuelto: First look at the new hybrid supercar\\n            \\n\\n\\nShortly after revealing the new Lamborghini Revuelto, the company's first-ever hybrid supercar, the company took journalists for a tour around the factory, where the production of the Revuelto is being ramped up before deliveries to customers can start. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRevuelto is probably the most aggressive-looking Lambo ever, which wasn't easy to achieve given the company's history. \\nCredit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\\n\\n\\nLamborghini's production line values precisionIf I had to describe Lamborghini's production line in one word, it would be precision. In one part of the factory, lumps of carbon fiber are being molded and laminated to create the Revuelto's ultra-light monocoque. In another, the vehicle's dizzyingly complex, new hybrid drivetrain is being painstakingly put together. In some areas, we are forbidden to take photos; some are completely off limits, and we can only see them from afar. \\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch high-speed autonomous race cars go head-to-head on the track\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention to detail and respect for the fancy materials used in the construction of a supercar are on display at every corner. Here's an example: The nappa leather that will be used in a car's interior is first inspected in a large machine, equipped with four projectors and electronic pens, that lets the worker mark the parts that need to be cut without even touching the leather. The leather then goes into an automatic cutting machine, with knives that descend from above and precisely remove the marked bits. I ask, why go to such trouble to cut the leather? The answer from one of the company's engineers is: Lamborghini wants to make sure the leather isn't tarnished in any way. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe leather that goes into the Revuelto is sourced from northern Italy and is not to be touched unless necessary.\\nCredit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\\n\\n\\nThe company's execs keep reminding us how highly skilled the workers in the factory are. You can't just start working on an actual Lamborghini on your first day on the job; some roles require weeks of specialized training; for some, workers have to train a minimum of six months before they can begin. Lamborghini buyers can choose from a variety of color combinations both for the car's exterior and interior, and they can also pick minute details such as custom images stitched onto the seats. In one part of the factory, we glimpse another way in which the customers get to feel special: a massive table is prepared for a dinner for the first Revuelto buyers, who get to enjoy fine Italian food whilst looking at the innards of their semi-assembled, future Lambos. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time, the passenger (copilot) gets a display of her own. \\nCredit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\\n\\n\\nRevuelto's customization extends to the infotainmentIn the Revuelto, the customization is extended onto the car's infotainment system. Lamborghinis of old haven't had a lot of displays; the multitude of knobs and switches you'll find in an Aventador are there to evoke the feeling of being in a race car or, perhaps, a rocket. The Revuelto still has its fair share of physical gizmos to press, but it also has three displays: one for the pilot (that's the driver), another for the copilot (that's the passenger), and a center display that's pretty much what you'll find in most modern cars \\u2014 displaying incoming calls, climate controls, and media details. It can all be customized by dragging, dropping, and rearranging various items with simple touch gestures. Yes, it's not exactly unheard of (Lamborghini's newer Huracans have a similar, albeit smaller, center display), but for Lamborghini's flagship car, it's a massive leap forward. Apple CarPlay as well as Android Auto support is here, I've been told, and if you want to talk to your Lambo, you'll be speaking to Amazon's Alexa, which is the only voice assistant on board. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe infotainment system's UI looks like it came out of a computer game which may be good or bad, depending on your preferences. \\nCredit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\\n\\n\\nI asked Lamborghini's CTO, Rouven Mohr, about the car's hybrid drivetrain and the screen-friendly interior, and whether these could alienate the company's long-time supporters. \"Our customers know that this is the path forward. But trust me, the Revuelto is still very much a Lamborghini,\" he told me. All of the traits that make the Lambo a Lambo\\xa0\\u2014 the nutty acceleration, the growling sound, the outrageous design \\u2014 are still here, Mohr assured me. And the most important part of a Lamborghini, the emotion that it incites, is more powerful than ever, he added. We finish the day with a set of interviews with Lamborghini's execs next to yet another Revuelto posing for photographs. Sitting inside its incredibly low-positioned seat and playing with its gadgets, it's easy to forget that this thing isn't something that most people, including me, will be able to buy. Still, the Revuelto, which starts at about $600,000, is selling like hot cakes. If you want one, and have the cash to buy it, you'll have to wait about two years to get it. Fantasizing about owning one, as always, is free.

Apps like Tinder have implemented their own safety features, but if you're going to chat with and potentially meet strangers, it's important to know the ins and outs of keeping yourself safe in the digital world and IRL. Some of these tips come from RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.Safety tips when signing up for dating appsFirst off, don't sign up with a dating app using a social media account like Facebook or Instagram. Previously, Bumble only had the option to sign up through Facebook. Thankfully, that's no more, and you can sign up for Bumble with your phone number. In fact, for other popular apps as well like Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid, you can sign up with a phone number or email.\\xa0That's good news, because if you sign up with social media, it allows data from either platform to be exchanged with each other. This is why if you signed up with your Instagram account, for instance, matches may show up as recommended people to follow. While it's tempting to sign up through a social platform and let it populate your profile for you, it allows this exchange of data.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Daters have a 'reality gap' about gender equality, Bumble says\\n            \\n\\n\\n\"By connecting Instagram to your profile, you\\u2019re giving Meta all the data points necessary to connect these people together on Instagram,\" said Tim Maliyil, founder of encryption and mobile security service AlertBoot. He himself has seen women from dating sites pop up on Instagram.Another component is photos; when you sign up through a social account, the dating app will likely use pictures from said account. This can make it easy for potential matches to find you elsewhere online. Therefore, in addition to signing up with an email or phone number, use different photos than are on your social media.\\xa0If you're still concerned about people finding your social media profiles, lock them or adjust privacy settings.Safety tips when swiping and searching for matchesBe diligent when looking at fellow singles' profiles. If they're verified (a feature which Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid have), then you know this person looks like their pictures. But if they don't have a photo, or only have one, and they're not verified, that might be a red flag.\\xa0If they appear too-good-to-be-true \\u2014 aka their photos look like magazine ads \\u2014 you can screenshot someone's profile and reverse image search to see if someone is potentially catfishing, or lying about who they are online. If you think something fishy is going on, report the user to the app (which will probably give you the option to block, as well).\\xa0If their Facebook or Instagram account is connected, you can take advantage and look them up. Do they have a new, sparce Facebook account with two friends, as opposed to a decade-old account with schools listed and hundreds of connections? You'll probably want to swipe left on the former.Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.Safety tips when talking to people onlineA big red flag is if a match wants to immediately hop off the app and talk elsewhere \\u2014 or, worse, if they immediately want to meet up. Stick to chatting on the app at first. For one, scammers can use your phone number to impersonate you. For another, if a match goes south, it'll be a relief that they don't have your number. There's no rush!\\xa0Besides wanting to meet up immediately, another red flag is if they never want to meet nor video chat. This could be the work of a romance scammer, who pretends to be someone else on dating apps in order to get people to send them money.\\xa0For this reason, never share personal information (i.e. your bank account details) and don't send money to a match. If someone is on the app for the reason you are \\u2014 to date! \\u2014 they won't ask for either.If you're chatting with someone and feel uncomfortable (say if they're too forward) feel free to unmatch and/or report them.\\xa0Safety tips when going on a date with an online matchAs Mashable culture reporter Meera Navlakha advised, video chat before going on a date. Some apps, like Tinder, even have functions to do this in-app so you don't have to exchange phone numbers. By video chatting beforehand, you can assure your date is who they say they are \\u2014 and you may even find out if the chemistry isn't there, which would save you both time on an IRL date!\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How to safely meet up on a Tinder date\\n            \\n\\n\\nIf the video date goes off without a hitch, it's time to meet in person. Meet in a public place, and tell your support system (family, friends) where you are; you can even turn on your location for them so they can know exactly where you are.Don't rely on the date for transportation, so you can leave on your own accord if you're feeling uncomfortable.

First, it's worth addressing the awkwardness of the interview (you can watch parts of it in the video below), which was broadcast on Twitter Spaces on Wednesday. Musk does his typical dance between attempting to be funny and eliciting sympathy by saying how hard it has been to lay off a massive number of Twitter employees. But when asked whether the sacked employees should've been given prior notice, the Twitter CEO avoids answering, instead passing the ball back to Clayton. And when questioned on the rise of misinformation and fake news on Twitter since Musk took over, he seemingly gets irritated, asking the interviewer to name one example from personal use (for the record, there are studies that point to the increase of \"misinformation superspreaders\" on Musk's Twitter).\\n\\n\\nKey points from the interview, which mostly revolves around Twitter, include the social media company being down to just 1,500 employees (down from more than 7,000), Musk's admission that shutting down a Twitter data center in December 2022 was \"quite catastrophic,\" and that Twitter is currently bleeding money but it's on the path of being cashflow positive \"within months. \" On the topic of frequent Twitter outages as of late, Musk says there have been \"a few,\" but \"not for very long.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Elon Musk says Twitter will ditch legacy blue checks on 4/20\\n            \\n\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest admission from Musk is that he ultimately went through with the Twitter acquisition deal because he felt the court would make him do it. \"Yes, that is the reason,\" Musk told the BBC. As far as who's running things at Twitter right now (Musk previously said he would abide by the results of a Twitter poll, in which users decided he should step down as CEO), he told Clayton it was his dog, Floki. \\u201cI'm not the CEO of Twitter. My dog is the CEO of Twitter. It's a great dog.\\u201d Musk said. \"He's got a black turtleneck, what more would you need?\"\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRevisiting the website that shaped the internet\\n\\n\\n\\nMusk also admitted that he shot himself in the foot with his tweets \"multiple times,\" and that he should probably stop tweeting after 3 a.m. \"I need bulletproof shoes at this point,\" he said.

You'll get your pick of most colorways, the same 18 hours of battery life as the Series 8, and the same CPU (aka you won't notice a processing speed difference). The only reason we wouldn't jump on this deal is if you're not looking for a blood oxygen sensor or ECG monitoring, in which case you can get the experience you're looking for in the second-gen SE for about $60 less.More Apple Watch Series 7 dealsApple Watch Series 7 (41mm, GPS + cellular) with graphite stainless steel case \\u2014 $399 $650 at Walmart (save $251)Apple Watch SE deals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Opens in a new tab\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Apple\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Our pick: Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\\n            (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n$239.99 at Amazon (save $9.01)\\n\\nGet Deal\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy we like itUnless you're into the blood oxygen and ECG sensors, we're betting you won't really notice the difference between the second-gen SE and the Series 8 (or the Series 7, tbh). The watch comes equipped with the same S8 chip, the same 18-hour battery life, and the same basic tracking features (steps, irregular heart rate notifications, etc) that got most people on the smartwatch train in the first place. While the $9 markdown isn't spectacular, it does help make this budget-friendly watch a little more affordable \\u2014 if you're willing to wait, this watch does go down to $219 every now and then.

While $50 off isn't a huge price cut, the computer is only months old, so any price cut is worth a second look. Functionally, it's not all that different from the M1 Mac mini, but it does have a slight edge in processor speed \\u2014 and its starting price is $100 lower than the M1.

For millennials who were there, it's easy to imagine the soundtrack to showrunner Lee Sung Jin's series being scrawled in marker on a mix CD, one I'd probably have made a completely horrendous custom jewel case sleeve for on Microsoft Paint.Lee worked with music supervisor Tiffany Anders for Beef, following her excellent work on PEN15 and Reservation Dogs, to find tracks to underscore moments of poignancy, hilarity, or deep nostalgia. Paired harmoniously with Beef's score, composed by producer Bobby Krlic, aka The Haxan Cloak, every track picked by Lee and Anders radiates 1990s and 2000s energy. Whether a diegetic performance of Incubus' \"Drive\" by Danny Cho (yep, that's Steven Yeun playing live) or Hoobstank's \"The Reason\" underscoring a crucial exchange between Danny and Amy Lau (Ali Wong), every episode has a throwback treat. Maybe it's an A24 thing \\u2014\\xa0 Everything Everywhere All at Once wielded Nine Days' \"Absolutely (Story of a Girl)\" as a key theme \\u2014 or maybe it's riding the nostalgic wave of '90s/'00s music throwbacks fueling pop culture. But it all truly works in Beef.\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAli Wong and Steven Yeun on why revenge is a universal touchpoint in \\u2018Beef\\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That's all stuff I listened to when I was growing up,\" Lee tells Mashable. \"When I initially pitched the show back in 2019, it felt like such a novel idea. I was like, 'It's gonna be all '90s and early '00s. No one's done it before!' Now, that's the zeitgeist. But I also feel like the characters are kind of trapped in the past. They're very stunted in their spiritual and mental evolutions, so a lot of the issues they're dealing with, I felt were very prominent in their adolescence, at least, and also in mine.\\xa0\"There's something about the songs from that era that feel so Beef, for lack of a better word. Especially in the first half, we really wanted to pick songs that maybe back in the day didn't get their proper shine; not necessarily on all the critics' lists back in 2000. But if we were all being honest, they're bangers, they're timeless, and they're really great. We wanted to bring back some songs that maybe didn't get their proper due.\"Here's a look at all the '90s and '00s needle drops in Beef, and why they work so well.Hoobastank, \"The Reason\"\\n\\n\\nI'm not a peeeeerfect peeeeeersooooooon, and neither is Danny or Amy. Episode 1 ends with the ultimate belter ballad, Hoobastank's 2003 \"The Reason\" \\u2014\\xa0a song you'd better commit to if you pick it at karaoke. This is the type of song you would scream in your car at the traffic lights, road rage or not, valiantly attempting to hit anywhere near lead singer Doug Robb's high notes. You might have heard the track most recently going viral on TikTok through the #NotAPerfectPerson challenge, which saw users posting about questionable life choices using the song \\u2014 and which good sport Robb himself joined in on.A steadily climbing ballad of self-analysis and starting over new, the track preaches vulnerability and regret while cutting yourself some slack. So, yeah, it's the perfect track to introduce Danny Cho and Amy Lau, two people who smile through gritted teeth before becoming their most unhinged, selfish selves through their toxic, competitive, obsessive connection to each other. Watching Amy screaming \"What the fuck!?\" and chasing a gleeful Danny down her street after he pisses all over her bathroom, as Hoobastank's uplifting mega hit swells, is one of the series' best moments.\\n\\n\\nCollective Soul, \"Shine\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Collective Soul's eyebrow raise of a 1993 debut album title, Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid, the alt rock band's most popular song, \"Shine,\" plays in episode 2 when Danny and his brother Paul (Young Mazino) are working out and posting thirst traps by the pool. In the scene, Danny suggests starting a new contracting business together, seemingly making peace \\u2014 though it may serve Danny's interests more than Paul's. Danny reflects on his ex from the late '00s, Veronica, with Collective Soul playing in the background to boost this nostalgia. And though the band wasn't a religious group, the heavenly references in the lyrics match both Danny's church group tank top and his vocalised intentions to return to the congregation.\\xa0Tori Amos, \"Cornflake Girl\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBeginning in a scene of Amy and her husband George (Joseph Lee) making up after their gallery argument, Tori Amos' \"Cornflake Girl\" ends episode 2 as Danny drives to Amy's house in his vandalised truck holding a hammer and ready to do\\u2026something. A tale of friendship turned toxic, Amos' 1994 track from her second album Under the Pink is extremely fitting for Beef \\u2014 you can't get a more openly venomous relationship than Danny and Amy's, but Amy and George's connection may be subtly souring. You might have heard this one recently in another context, in Season 2 of fellow needle-dropper Yellowjackets, ending episode 1 right before Shauna decides to have a little snack on Jackie's ear.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Veruca Salt's 'Seether' was the perfect 'Yellowjackets' needle drop\\n            \\n\\n\\nIncubus, \"Drive\"\\n\\n\\nDid you know Steven Yeun can sing? You bet he can. Joining the Living Glory Church group for a singalong of Incubus' 2000 breakthrough single, \"Drive,'' Yeun sings live as Danny while playing guitar. It's the same episode where Danny breaks down in the same church to a performance by the church's band led by Edwin (Justin H. Min). Considering that Beef's entire charade begins with a road rage incident and veers chaotically into existential dread, Incubus' lyrics are pretty fitting: \"It's driven me before and seems to have a vague / Haunting mass appeal / But lately I'm beginning to find that I / Should be the one behind the wheel.\" Yeun spoke about his connection to singing in the Korean Christian church on Netflix's podcast Skip Intro, saying, \\u201cI used to lead praise at church.\" Later in the series, Yeun has another moment doing just this, as Danny fronts the band singing \"Amazing Grace.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Steven Yeun breaks down his emotional church scene in 'Beef'\\n            \\n\\n\\nSugar Ray, \"Fly\"\\n\\n\\nSomeone crack open a shitty beer on the way to the coast, because Sugar Ray and Super Cat's \"Fly\" is next. Playing to open episode 4, this 1997 radio favourite scores the awkward tension of Amy driving Paul home from their first real meeting as each other. All around the world statues crumble for Paul, as he simultaneously tries his flirt on while pitching his semi-valet startup, Portable Parking, while Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath sings about bouncy, breezy love and grieving one's mother. It's got it all!Limp Bizkit, \"Nookie\"\\n\\n\\nIf you're going to get your brother and your cousin drunk so you can sneak off to Las Vegas to see your crush, try shots of the nearest crappy liquor toasted to Limp Bizkit's \"Nookie.\" The pretty gross, misogynistic lead single from 1999's Significant Other was the group's first big hit, and goes perfectly with Danny and Isaac's (David Choe) plunge into passing out as Paul steals the truck. Too easy.Morphine, \"Cure for Pain\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe perfectly hazy, lazy track for Amy and Paul's Las Vegas hotel room silliness, Morphine's 1993 track \"Cure for Pain,\" appears in episode 4. The lyrics are quite literal for the scene, \"Someday there'll be a cure for pain / That's the day I throw my drugs away,\" but accompanied by Dana Colley's growling baritone saxophone, it creates a comforting space for both characters to let loose a little. Smoking weed, dropping Skittles in Coca-Cola, jumping on the bed, dancing in the dark, and eating mangosteen sprawled on the floor, it's the first time we've actually seen Amy have fun in Beef, and it's incredibly wholesome. \"It was really nice to do what I want for once,\" she says.The Offspring, \"Self Esteem\"\\n\\n\\nHands down, it's one of the best moments in Amy and Danny's rivalry for the whole series, scored with the brattiest song out. Ending episode 4, The Offspring's 1994 banger \"Self Esteem\" blares through the silent service halls of the Las Vegas casino as Danny is caught by security after crashing Amy's panel. Raising one finger and wagging it at his losing predicament, Amy truly enjoys this moment of victory. If she could pick a track to go with this smug win, it would probably be this very song.System of a Down, \"Lonely Day\"\\n\\n\\nThe angst is real at the end of episode 5, when George's mum Fumi (Patti Yasutake) surprises Isaac's trespassing mates in Amy's house, leading to her falling down the stairs. The track from 2005's Hypnotize is poignant mainly for how Lee develops Fumi's character in this episode, experiencing severe loneliness and isolation from her family and friends, despite her outward confidence and judgmental nature. \"Such a lonely day, and it's mine / The most loneliest day of my life / Such a lonely day should be banned / It's a day that I can't stand,\" reflects lead singer Serj Tankian as we're not quite sure whether or not Fumi is alive or not.Paula Cole, \"I Don't Want to Wait\"\\n\\n\\nIn what might be the funniest needle drop in the series, episode 6 sees Paula Cole's 1996 Dawson's Creek theme song cannonball the characters into romantic will-they-won't-they nostalgia. Simmering beneath the scene as George and Mia (Mia Serafino) all but confirm their attraction to one another, Cole's instantly recognisable track plays on the radio in the car as they decide to call it. Lee and Anders could have picked any track for this scene, and choosing delicious, reliable cheese, they allow George and Mia to earnestly ask themselves, \"Will it be yes, or will it be sorry?\"Bush, \"Machinehead\"\\n\\n\\nUnderscoring the church group's casual basketball league, which we already know Edwin takes rather seriously, comes Bush's 1994 track \"Machinehead.\" Marked by the song's \"Breathe in, breathe out,\" lyrics, the scene is all high fives, tank tops, and sweaty bravado, as Danny and Paul bond in victory while Edwin angrily scorns his own performance on the court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNothin' but net.\\nCredit: Netflix\\n\\n\\nKeane, \"Somewhere Only We Know\"\\n\\n\\nLook, I'm already unsteady thinking about this episode ending and this song. Keane's absolutely shameless pop heartbreaker from 2004, \"Somewhere Only We Know,\" punches you in the heart in episode 7, as Amy's world finally collapses thanks to Paul's reactive confession to George. Rushing home to explain, Amy finds her house empty, family gone, as Paul happily meets his own family in a restaurant, completely unscathed. It's the deepest cut yet for Amy, as is the next scene for Danny, arriving at the beautiful home he's built for his mother, father, and brother tragically burning to the ground. I'm going to need an entire Burger King meal to process this one, despite how many times I've heard this behind TikTok videos.Grant Lee Buffalo, \"Mockingbirds\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDanny is absolutely spiraling, having knocked out George and accidentally kidnapped Amy's daughter Junie in episode 8 as Grant Lee Buffalo's early '90s song \"Mockingbirds\" plays. Lead singer Grant Lee Phillips told American Songwriter he wrote this song after losing his home in the 1994 Northridge earthquake: \"Pick the cataclysm of your choice. That\\u2019s where it\\u2019s coming from. Although, when you stop and consider lyrics like \\u2018Devastation, at last, finally we meet,\\u2019 that is indeed very much the feeling one had as they walked out into the rubble of what was their home.\" Yes, I am taking this as a giant reference to the emotional and literal rubble Danny and Amy are currently sifting through.Bj\\xf6rk, \"All Is Full of Love\"\\n\\n\\nAfter Amy's monologue about unconditional love fading, Bj\\xf6rk's delicate, gentle 1997 moody masterpiece \"All Is Full of Love\" is the perfect accompaniment to the fallout of episode 9, when Danny and Amy feel more isolated, helpless, and frustratingly connected than ever before. The Icelandic icon repeating the words \"You'll be given love / You'll be taken care of / You'll be given love / You have to trust it,\" almost feels like Lee and Anders giving the protagonists a much needed cuddle in the midst of an absolute shitstorm. The shocking, violent run of the episode leads Amy and Danny quite literally to veer off the road together (that shot), finding themselves with no one but each other in the darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan't live with each other. Can't live without each other.\\nCredit: Netflix\\n\\n\\nThe Smashing Pumpkins, \"Mayonaise\"\\n\\n\\n\\nEnding the final episode of the series with The Smashing Pumpkins' 1993 track \"Mayonaise\" is a feat that wraps up the entire soundtrack in a deeply moving package. Closing that stunner of a finale, as Amy and Danny cling to each other for literal dear life, lead singer Billy Corgan sings, \"We'll try and ease the pain / But somehow, we'll feel the same / Well, no one knows / Where our secrets go.\" It's the perfect anthem for our protagonists.Rolling Stone explains the song's title has a fittingly vague and fact-fluctuating history: \"In 1996, an exasperated Corgan said during an online chat in Dublin, 'You know how I got the title \\u2018Mayonaise\\u2019? I looked in my refrigerator.' He also told a Colombian radio station that it's actually a phonetic way of writing 'my own eyes.' A 1996 interview with KROQ is probably the closest we'll get to a real insight on the title. 'Sometimes you just gotta open up your brain and just see what comes in,' he said.\"That last one?

Here's how to watch.", "description": "Europe is about to send a spacecraft on an epic quest to study Jupiter's icy moons, a mission that won't begin in earnest for another eight years when it finally reaches its deep space destination.The so-called \"Juice\" mission is intended to focus its research on Europa, Callisto, and particularly Ganymede, three large moons orbiting the gas giant planet a half-billion miles away. These moons have intrigued scientists for years, because they're thought to have liquid oceans trapped beneath icy shells. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one known to have its own magnetic field, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). The mission will explore these worlds and investigate whether life could have ever flourished in this realm.The ESA will attempt to launch Juice on an Ariane 5 rocket from its spaceport in French Guiana on the South American continent. It will be the space agency's last time using the rocket before it transitions to a new propulsion system. Liftoff is slated for 8:15 a.m. EST / 14:15 CEST Thursday April 13. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Webb telescope snaps thrilling images of Jupiter and hurtling asteroids\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nTo understand the possibility of habitability, scientists need to explore the Jupiter system as a whole, said Olivier Witasse, a Juice mission scientist, during a recent ESA news conference. That means learning as much as they can about Jupiter's atmosphere and weather, strong rotating magnetic field, the volcanic moon Io, the other moons, and how they're all interconnected.

If successful, it will be the first time in history a spacecraft has ever orbited a moon other than Earth's when it loops around Ganymede in 2034. NASA and the Japanese and Israeli space agencies have contributed scientific instruments for the mission.\\n    Jupiter's \"really a miniaturized solar system.\" \\n    \\n\"Juice\" is a wonky acronym for Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, fitting for Ganymede's mythological namesake, who served as Jupiter's personal cupholder. The study seeks to answer several key questions: How do gas giants like Jupiter function; how did Jupiter's moons form; could there have been life on or around Jupiter in its past or even now; what are these oceanic moons like; and what makes Ganymede so different?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe large icy moon Ganymede peeks out from behind Jupiter. \\nCredit: NASA / ESA / Hubble / E. Karkoschka \\n\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges for the mission was designing a spacecraft and instruments for the unusual environment around Jupiter. Particles from the volcanic moon Io are trapped by Jupiter's potent magnetic field, creating extreme radiation. \"We really had to put all the most sensitive equipment inside vaults, literally boxes lined with lead, that will stop most of the radiation from reaching the electronics,\" said Alessandro Atzei, the payload system engineer.

Finally, a game for the maths-camp kids.Created by New York Times' in-house Games team, Digits is currently in public beta testing, which means you can play it right now. It won't be around for long, though. The maths game will only be available for one week, after which it will be taken down and the success of the test evaluated.\\xa0The results of Digits' beta test will determine whether it eventually joins Wordle as a New York Times stalwart, or is abandoned as a failed experiment.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The Wordle board game is fun for dedicated players, but slightly boring for others\\n            \\n\\n\\nWork on Digits began in late 2021 after the concept was put forward during a New York Times games jam. It was based on two numeric game shows: French program Des Chiffres et des Lettres and English show Countdown.This was also around the same time Wordle began sweeping the globe, the influence of which can be seen in Digits' green and gold colour scheme. The New York Times eventually acquired Wordle in Jan. 2022, which delayed work on Digits while the team integrated it into the Times' website.How to play 'Digits'The premise of Digits is one you've probably seen before: You're given a set of six numbers, and must add, subtract, divide, and multiply them by each other to get as close to a given result as possible.You don't have to use all of the numbers, but you can't use each more than once since they will disappear once used. For example, if I chose to multiply a 7 and 3, they'd combine to create a 21 I could use to do more maths. However the original 7 and 3 will be gone, so I won't then be able to add 7 to my 21.This also means there's a limit to how many operations you can do, as you'll run out of numbers after five. Fortunately Digits is a bit more merciful than Wordle, and does provide you with an undo button for when you've mathed yourself into a corner. You can also try solving a puzzle multiple times, so you aren't locked into your disappointing first result.Digits doesn't apply a strict pass/fail system, instead granting players up to three stars based on how close they get to the target number. You can earn one star for being within 25 places of the goal, two stars for being within 10 places, and three stars for landing on it exactly. Digits won't accept answers that don't earn at least one star.There are five new Digits puzzles per day, meaning you can earn up to 15 stars. You can switch between tabs to tackle them in any order you want as well, which may be useful if you find yourself stuck on a particular puzzle. You can also opt to give up and have the answer revealed, though that will prevent you from earning any more stars on the puzzle.Like Wordle, new Digits puzzles will be released daily at midnight. It also has a sharing system to help you show off which operations you performed, the order in which you used them, and the final number you arrived at. Digits' share button won't show up until you've finished all five puzzles though, so you'll have to ace the entire test if you want to brag about your score on Twitter.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/digits-wordle-maths-game-nyt", "pubDate": "Wed, 12 Apr 2023 07:15:24 +0000"}, {"title": "Lifetime access to this AI photo editor is on sale for 80% off", "description": "TL;DR: The Luminar Neo Lifetime Bundle is on sale for \\xa363.96, saving you 80% on list price.Anyone can take a picture, but for a while, you generally needed a professional if you wanted great-quality edits of your photo after the fact.

But if you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.Where did Wordle come from?Originally created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, Wordle rapidly spread to become an international phenomenon, with thousands of people around the globe playing every day. Alternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\\xa0Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.Not the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for April 11.What's the best Wordle starting word?The best Wordle starting word is the one that brings joy to your heart. But if what brings you joy is strategy, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.Is Wordle getting harder?It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:It's a substance, rather than a thing or concept.Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?Not today!Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...Today's Wordle starts with the letter B.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Wordle-obsessed?

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?No.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?No.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?I, D, C, and T.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

In a Monday evening update addressed to the university community, Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway wrote, \"If there is no movement towards an agreement, we will have no choice but to take legal action to assure the continued academic progress of our students and prevent irreparable harm.

My beloved Kansas City Chiefs are champions once again. And it's time for all of us cord-cutters to figure out how the heck we're going to watch football in 2023.Fortunately, the answer is easy, if a bit pricey. Starting in the 2023 season, YouTube TV will be the exclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticket, a streaming subscription that allows you to watch every out-of-market NFL game live on Sundays. With YouTube TV and Sunday Ticket, you can see every NFL game you could possibly want to see.And you might want to pony up the cash now instead of waiting for September.

In practical terms, that means you can now access it without a satellite subscription and, thus, without dealing with all the ridiculous hidden fees that come with a satellite subscription.But you're still going to have to pay, and pay quite a bit to get Sunday Ticket. The regular price for Sunday Ticket if you subscribe to YouTube TV will be $349, on top of the $73/mo you already pay for the base service. That doesn't get you Sunday Ticket forever; you just get it for one season. There's also a $389 option that bundles Sunday Ticket and RedZone, a special channel that whips through all the NFL action on a Sunday, going from game to game when the action starts getting exciting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere's where you add Sunday Ticket and RedZone to your YouTube TV plan.\\nCredit: Screenshot: Google\\n\\n\\nSidenote: RedZone is 100 percent worth it if you really care about football. It's seven straight hours of commercial-free football and you only see the fun parts. It's intoxicating. You can add either of those options to your YouTube TV plan by going to your Google account and clicking on \"Payments and Subscriptions.\" That's not all, though. Google is also offering Sunday Ticket and RedZone through its PrimeTime Channels service. Put simply, this is a way to get all of the NFL action without paying for YouTube TV on top of it. Unfortunately, there's a big price hike if you decide to go down this road. Via Primetime Channels, NFL Sunday Ticket will cost $449, and the RedZone bundle costs $489.And that's still not all. If you subscribe to any of those options before June 6, you'll get a $100 discount. Suddenly, for YouTube TV subscribers, Sunday Ticket plus RedZone for $289 doesn't seem like such a bad deal. It definitely beats the price of going to a bar every week, and it's less risky than watching football through, erm, other, less reliable means.Whether you choose to patronize Google or keep watching football your own way, at least now you know there's a way to get everything for less than a month's rent.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-price", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 19:59:41 +0000"}, {"title": "Lofi Girl has a new companion: Synth Boy", "description": "If you're a student, or otherwise looking for an endless stream of \"beats to relax/study to,\" you know Lofi Girl.

Step one: Lure us in with the screwball promise of SNL legend Bill Hader as the titular assassin-turned-actor. Step two: Masterfully modulate tone until we're left with an unflinching examination of how characters justify their worst impulses. The final result: a brilliant show that will leave you wondering who, if anyone, can earn redemption.That magic continues in Season 4, which steers the bloody saga of Barry Berkman toward a brutal conclusion. Co-creators Hader and Alec Berg fully embrace the darkness of \"dark comedy\" in a way that even the previous seasons haven't, delivering a relentless set of episodes that push Barry and everyone around him to their limits.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Beef' is one of Netflix's best shows ever, and it's all about chemistry\\n            \\n\\n\\nBarry Season 4 picks up with Barry in jail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHenry Winkler in \"Barry.\"\\nCredit: Merrick Morton / HBO\\n\\n\\nThe consequences of the past finally caught up to Barry in the Season 3 finale, when he was arrested for murdering Janice Moss (Paula Newsome) way back in Season 1. Now in prison, Barry seeks forgiveness from those he has wronged, like acting teacher Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler) and ex Sally Reed (Sarah Goldberg). Unlike its main character, Barry knows that the road to forgiveness is longer than one phone call from jail. It also knows that in Barry's case, forgiveness and redemption are forever out of reach. Hader's work this season reveals Barry at his most desperate, his most angry, and even at his most frightening, as he continues to try to defend his own actions to himself.Outside the prison walls, Gene and Janice's father Jim (Robert Wisdom) have differing ideas on how to honor Janice's memory, a storyline that puts the heights of Gene's ego on hilarious, cringe-inducing display. It also cements Wisdom's Jim as one of the most fascinating and enigmatic additions to Barry's cast of characters. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnthony Carrigan and Michael Irby in \"Barry.\"\\nCredit: Merrick Morton / HBO\\n\\n\\nWhile Barry is trapped in jail \\u2014 with former handler Fuches (Stephen Root), no less \\u2014 NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan) and Cristobal (Michael Irby) set out on a new venture with some unlikely criminal allies. What ensues are some of Barry's most laugh-out-loud moments yet \\u2014 I will never look at Dave & Buster's the same way again \\u2014 as well as many of its most harrowing. Of course, it wouldn't be Barry without some sharp showbiz satire thrown in the mix: After a disastrous stint back home in Missouri, Sally returns to Los Angeles to teach an acting class of her own. Barry packs in some quality gags about tentpole franchises, but it also keeps a close eye on Sally's reaction to Barry's arrest, her past traumas, and her own monstrous qualities. A scene in which Sally breaks a student down over the course of an acting class is a reminder of just how ruthless she's become, and how phenomenal Goldberg is in this role. Barry's cast has always been killer, but in Season 4, everyone ups their game.Barry Season 4 delivers series-best sequences.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSarah Goldberg in \"Barry.\"\\nCredit: Merrick Morton / HBO\\n\\n\\nAlongside excellent writing and acting, this season of Barry continues the show's trend of creating some of the most stunning, impactful visuals on TV today. Season 4 is Barry at its most surreal. While in jail, Barry's past bleeds into his present: He sees Sally and his acting class friends running lines in the prison yard. Later, in a similar vein to his beach hallucination in Season 3, he recalls his childhood in an endless field somewhere in the Midwest.Hader, who directed every episode this season, and director of photography Carl Herse thrive in these darker, dreamier sequences. Barry may be more easily described as a dark comedy or dramedy, but these episodes are so tinged with horror, dread, and the bizarre that they escape classification. More than once, they'll leave you questioning reality.Barry's destabilizing quality is perhaps what I'll miss most about it. This is the rare series that can leap from gut-busting gag to gut-wrenching moral dilemma and always stick the landing. Moments like Season 2's \"ronny/lily\" fight or Season 3's \"710N\" motorcycle chase deliver a mix of the surreal and the mundane, the grounded and the heightened, all helping make Barry the force it is and the force it continues to be as it heads into its final season. Luckily for us, Season 4 gifts us many such sequences, at times even outdoing itself in terms of sheer storytelling boldness. It's Barry's final magic trick: a mad blaze of self-destructive glory from all characters that will knock you off your feet.The first two episodes of Barry premiere at 10 p.m. ET on April 16 on HBO and HBO Max, with new episodes airing weekly.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/barry-season-4-review", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 14:00:00 +0000"}, {"title": "HBO Max and Discovery+ to merge into an app called Max", "description": "CEO David Zaslav's stewardship of Warner Bros.

From the A24 auteur who brought you Hereditary and Midsommar, Ari Aster, comes a three-hour journey through the many anxieties of Beau (Joaquin Phoenix). A man in his 50s with a very complicated relationship with his domineering mother (Patti LuPone), Beau lives in solo squalor in his apartment, surrounded by a horror-show menagerie of the chronically anxious' worst-case scenarios both indoors and out. He must embark on a journey, with the audience brought along for the ride \\u2014 one that is funny, scary, deeply weird, and also maybe boring, according to the reviews. Suffice to say, Beau Is Afraid is likely to be incredibly divisive. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nHere's a little bit of what the critics said about the film, with minimal plot spoilers and some mood spoilers.Mashable's own Kristy Puchko:As he has in his first two films, Aster has paired powerful performers with a script that plunges into the surreal and the psychological. His movies feel like a dare, challenging audiences with visuals of beautiful bodies destroyed by self-loathing, audio that creeps under your skin, and plot twists that feel wrong yet oh, so terribly right.\\xa0... This is the world we know at its very worst... and at its most chaotically fun. Still, I can't promise you'll enjoy Beau Is Afraid. I can promise it'll fuck you up.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Beau Is Afraid' review: Ari Aster delivers a brilliant, 3-hour-long panic attack\\n            \\n\\n\\nBut don't worry! It is a comedy!IGN, Siddhant Adlakha:[A]bove all else, what makes Beau Is Afraid such a riveting watch is that it\\u2019s funny and terrifying in equal measure, often in the same moments. It achieves what Joker \\u2013 which featured Phoenix\\u2019s Oscar-winning performance \\u2013 failed to with jarring tone, practically transforming Aster\\u2019s signature close ups, of dead faces frozen in moments of fear and anguish, into Greek comedy masks. ... [I]t\\u2019s the kind of movie worth recommending for its ambition alone, merely to witness the audacious result of anxious self-loathing writ large across the silver screen, without an ounce of restraint. That it\\u2019s also a remarkably well-crafted horror-comedy is a cherry on top. Slashfilm, Chris Evangelista:There will be those who simply cannot stand the fraught world Aster has created here, and there will be others who are fully on board with what the filmmaker is dishing out. No matter the reaction, this is a film that begs for conversation and analysis and plenty of pondering. And it's more accessible than you might think, despite all the lunacy. Aster is primarily known as a horror filmmaker, and while \"Beau\" is not a horror film, there's plenty of the horrific here to knock us for a loop. Beau is afraid, and you will be, too.Consequence, Clint Worthington:Beau Is Afraid is ostensibly Aster\\u2019s \\u201ccomedy,\\u201d though it\\u2019s tinged with the same phantasmagoria as his previous efforts: Here, he\\u2019s stepping pretty visibly into Charlie Kaufman territory, using the language of cinema to externalize his deep-seated anxieties about his mother, his life, and every anxiety he\\u2019s ever had. ... It should also be stressed that, despite Aster\\u2019s pedigree and the suffocating anxiety of the situations Beau finds himself in, Beau is Afraid is also\\xa0deeply,\\xa0bleakly funny. Fiona Crombie\\u2019s production design sits Beau in a ridiculous world of absurd posters and signs ... and the sheer volume of Beau\\u2019s misfortunes become funnier the taller they\\u2019re stacked.Almost every review I've found so far namechecks Charlie Kaufman, so just take that as read. But that doesn't guarantee a rave review, of course.\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCritics praise \\u2018Midsommar\\u2019 for its disturbing horror, surprising humor\\n\\n\\n\\nVariety, Peter Debruge:Aster tracks his titular antihero from birth to death, from psychoanalysis to this cheeky subversion of Freud, where the child assumes responsibility for his parents\\u2019 trauma, rather than the other way around. But he\\u2019s crammed so many ideas into this unwieldy container, the film capsizes. In retrospect, \\u201cHereditary\\u201d did too, but we forgave it because its finale was frightening, at least. Here, wrapping with an anticlimax seems to be Aster\\u2019s idea of a joke.The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw:\"Running at over three hours, Beau Is Afraid is a colossal recovered memory of mock Oedipal agony which is scary, boring and sad in approximate proportions of 1 to 4 to 2. It\\u2019s a movie in which Aster has surrendered some of his own originality and distinction for an indulgent, derivative flourish that seems to pastiche Charlie Kaufman or Darren Aronofsky\\u2019s crazy Mother! or maybe even Richard Kelly\\u2019s much controverted Southland Tales.\"Even the haterade-chugging Bradshaw has to agree on one point, though. Freudian freakshow horror-comedy needs its mothers (!) to loom large, and both Zoe Lister-Jones (who plays Beau's mother in flashback) and Broadway legend Patti LuPone are more than up to the task of taking on the role of Aster's Beau's mother.AwardsWatch, Sophia Ciminello:LuPone is absolutely terrifying in this film. She\\u2019s a towering mogul of a mother whose son exists to disappoint her. LuPone\\u2019s presence and brilliant choices as an actress make everything Beau is experiencing click into place. Beau\\u2019s fears and the bad luck that befalls him grow to feel even more outlandish and comical, but Phoenix\\u2019s performance makes them feel real and grounded in this utterly chaotic world.\\xa0... If the magical realism, difficult emotions, and detailed symbols feel a bit intense, that\\u2019s entirely warranted. Beau Is Afraid is an exhausting experience with too many details to take in in one sitting alone, but that\\u2019s also the point.In fact, more than one reviewer noted that no matter how long the film is, there's no question that it will reward repeat viewings.RogerEbert.com, Nick Allen:Any admirer of \\u201cHereditary\\u201d and \\u201cMidsommar\\u201d knows those movies are better understood with multiple viewings and a closer look at the mechanics each time. Part of Aster\\u2019s extraordinary skill as an entertainer, when revealing these plots about horrific relationships, is in playing with how much an audience gets on their first viewing, as opposed to their second or third. I\\u2019m curious, most of all, how the emotions within \\u201cBeau Is Afraid\\u201d will show more intricacy, or collapse under their weight, once all three hours of it feels more familiar.Beau Is Afraid is in theaters April 21.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/beau-is-afraid-reviews-critics-reactions", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 10:17:33 +0000"}, {"title": "Webb telescope captures the divine colors of a star's death", "description": "About 340 years ago, long before the United States was a country, light that had traveled through space and time from a huge exploding star finally reached Earth.Cassiopeia A, the wispy kaleidoscope of colors swirling in this image, is the youngest-known supernova remnant in the Milky Way.

No big deal. It's a curious-looking snailfish, and at 27,349 feet (8,336 meters) down, it's the deepest fish ever observed. Researchers spotted the critter on a deep sea expedition in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, located south of Japan, after lowering a camera with bait down into the ocean's \"hadal zone.\" This cryptic region is named for the Greek god of the underworld, and is home to the deepest of the seas. The record-breaking observation, announced in early April 2023, was made by scientists at the University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology.Even at such remote hadal depths, researchers noted that snailfish generally spotted in the region were a \"large and somewhat lively population of fish.\" Yet how might these animals survive such crushing pressure and isolated conditions? The answer is that snailfish, like this deepest-observed fish of the genus Pseudoliparis, are fantastically strange, with clever adaptations.  \"Overall, very deep sea fishes (those living in the abyssal and hadal zones) tend to be small, flabby or jelly-like, eel-shaped fishes living slow lives, [that] like to binge eat and hunt using the blue light of their prey,\" Jessica Arbour, a biologist at Middle Tennessee State University, told Mashable over email.  I asked Alan Jamieson, the chief scientist of this hadal expedition and founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, how he and his team reacted when they saw the record-breaking fish in the video. \"In total admiration for how deep these little goofy fish can go,\" Jamieson said.You can see the record-breaking fish in the clip below.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Scientists discover ancient shark swimming in a really strange place\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nResisting unfathomable pressureAt tens of thousands of feet under the surface, the microscopic proteins in animal cells are weakened and become unstable. This is problematic, because proteins are critical to the functioning of animals' organs and tissues. But snailfish churn out a chemical, called trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, that stops proteins from changing under such extreme physical stress. \"This name may be unfamiliar, but TMAO is what gives fishes their characteristic 'fishy' smell,\" Mackenzie Gerringer, a biologist at the State University of New York at Geneseo, told Mashable. TMAO is quite effective. For reference, the pressure in the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench, is like an elephant standing on your fingernail, Geneseo explained. This deepest-observed snailfish wasn't observed at quite this depth, but it's a decent approximation. Snailfish have evolved their bodies in other major ways to withstand the relentless pressure. Fish in shallow waters use a gas bladder to float (aka \"maintain neutral buoyancy\"). But these bladders compress in the deep sea. So snailfish don't even have this organ. Instead, they remain buoyant with fewer or smaller bones, more cartilage, and smaller structures like fins, which makes them somewhat eel-like, Arbour explained. And snailfish skin is jelly-like \\u2014 as opposed to scaly \\u2014 to help stay buoyant. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnailfish captured on camera in the hadal zone of the Izu-Ogasawara Trench.\\nCredit:  Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre / University of Western Australia\\n\\n\\nExpert eaters in the deepest seasFood in the ocean's remote trenches generally isn't nearly as plentiful as near the surface, where hungry creatures will find bountiful algae and other creatures traversing rich reefs.In the deeps, life depends on nutrients sinking down from above. Creatures subsist on these particles, then bigger animals eat those critters. And snailfish are well equipped to capitalize on this prey.\\n    \"One hadal snailfish can have more than a hundred of these amphipods in its stomach at a time!\"\\n    \\n\"They have very large mouths and stomachs, so they can cash in on a large food item when available,\" Arbour explained.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA CT scan of both snailfish jaws.\\nCredit: Adam Summers / University of Washington\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo deep sea snailfish collected on the expedition into the Izu-Ogasawara Trench.\\nCredit: Caladan Oceanic\\n\\n\\nTheir food often takes the form of small crustaceans, called amphipods. In the video above, the snailfish are actually chowing down on amphipods (which were attracted to the fish). Snailfish use \"suction feeding\" to catch these prey, Gerringer explained, by rapidly expanding their mouth and creating a \"suction force that pulls in the amphipod.\" But that's not all: Hadal snailfish have a second set of jaws in the back of their throat that crush the hapless prey. It's an effective means of eating.\"One hadal snailfish can have more than a hundred of these amphipods in its stomach at a time!\" Gerringer emphasized.Seeing in the darkThe deep, deep sea is either a lightless or largely lightless realm. Many fish are adapted to see the type of blue-green light that can penetrate through deep waters, though in hadal zones there's little sunlight to be found. But snailfish capitalize on the bioluminescence, or light created by organisms, in the darkness. Creatures luminesce for hunting or attracting mates, among other reasons.\"Snailfish seem particularly well adapted to seeing the dim blue light specifically produced by bioluminescence of their prey,\" Arbour explained.Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox?

New FCC leaders could offer hope for a fairer internet, though undoing years of net neutrality bashing is an uphill battle. Squashing these protections essentially gives internet service providers the green light to dish unfair treatment to certain web traffic \\u2014\\xa0like throttling a Netflix connection or charging extra to use a certain social media platform. And don't get us started on how it could affect smaller sites with smaller budgets.Discussions about the government's right to spy on your digital habits without a warrant don't exactly make anyone feel confident, either.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Using Google Chrome to manage your passwords is a bad idea. Here's why.\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhatever the reason, people are becoming more and more paranoid about the vulnerability of their internet usage (that, or they're just really tired of American Netflix). In turn, Google has become littered with VPN reviews and lists of the best VPNs according to experts, tech publishers, and regular consumers alike. But if you wanted a more raw take on the day-to-day VPN experience from normal people (with no filter), there's only one place to go: Reddit. What is a VPN used for?The bottom line is simple: People don't want other people watching what they're doing online, even if they're not doing anything wrong.A VPN (virtual private network) is an internet security subscription that basically allows you to make up your own internet rules. It acts as a bodyguard between you and your internet service provider (and hackers, and other third-party weirdos) by hollowing out a personal anonymity tunnel through which you perform all of your internet activities. A VPN's job is to plug the holes that could be making your data vulnerable to nefarious eyeballs, like creeps scouring public WiFi networks for personal information that could be used to steal your identity. VPNs are as wise of a precaution as antivirus software or a password manager (yes, this applies to Macs too). Hackers love free WiFi for the same reason you do: Connecting to the internet requires no authentication. That network is littered with unsecured devices, many times belonging to working professionals with bank accounts and business credentials that have phishers frothing at the mouth. Often, the easiest thing for hackers to do is slide in between your device and the connection point. This Man-in-the-Middle situation is like eavesdropping, but on emails, credit card info, and work logins. Other hackers use public WiFi to unleash malware to all of the suckers using the network without protection.Many folks avoid the public WiFi risk by recruiting their phone's hotspot. But on the flip side, cellular data limits might be an issue \\u2014\\xa0setting up a situation where both a laptop and phone need VPN protection. Many Reddit users suggest using something like EasyTether to share the VPN connection in a reverse hotspot of sorts.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Best streaming deals for Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and more this week\\n            \\n\\n\\nAre free VPNs the move?Reddit has strong feelings about this. It's bluntly summed up here in response to an inquiry about the \"best free VPN\":\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: reddit/screenshot\\n\\n\\nReddit users will let you know that comparing free VPNs to paid VPNs just doesn't make sense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, and you'll almost definitely be skimping on some crucial features by taking the cheapest-possible route. The proof isn't always provided, but many Redditors are convinced that free VPNs don't follow a true no-log policy, or that they sell your data to third parties. \"Free\" is sometimes synonymous with \"slow\" due to fewer servers in fewer locations.The general consensus seems to be to only use a free VPN to test the waters, then cough up the credit card info (or Paypal, or Bitcoin, or Visa gift cards from your grandma). Most times, this can be done through a trusted paid VPN that has a free tier to experiment with, or via a free trial, which many services offer. In a rare turn of events, Reddit backs Windscribe's free service hard. However, free VPNs can step up to the job for more temporary endeavors \\u2014 like having access to your home country's streaming services while going abroad for a semester or keeping up with a certain sport for a season. Because paid VPNs only really get affordable when a one or two-year subscription is met, it may not make sense to pay $10 or $12 per month for the few months that you need a VPN.Here are the VPNs that Reddit users recommend the most in 2023:", "link": "https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpns-on-reddit", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 09:03:28 +0000"}, {"title": "I ditched my oven for this celebrity-brand air fryer and I've never looked back", "description": "When my six-month old Viking oven randomly called it quits on me one evening (leaving me with a sheet pan of uncooked salmon filets and a panic of rethinking dinner), I knew an air fryer was the next best thing. I usually don't have high expectations of celebrity-owned brands, but the Beautiful 9-quart TriZone air fryer by Drew Barrymore rose to the occasion when I needed it most. Not only did it help me survive an oven-less kitchen until the new part for my Viking oven arrived, but it ultimately helped me get more creative with my recipes.The air fryer did the job of everything I would normally have my oven do, including warming up my bread (because, gasp, I don't own a toaster), roast vegetables, and reheat frozen items. It also inspired me to try new dishes like the viral air fryer fried eggs (more on that later) and managed to look good while doing its job even though it's large and in charge. If you ever find yourself with a broken oven like me, or you're simply in the market for a new air fryer, the Beautiful 9-quart TriZone air fryer is certainly worthy of countertop space.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best (and worst) air fryer recipes we've tried\\n            \\n\\n\\nUsing the air fryerThis air fryer features a touchscreen display, cooking temperatures from 90 degrees Fahrenheit to 450 degrees, and six various cooking functions (air fry, broil, roast, reheat, bake, and dehydrate). What sets this air fryer apart from others that I've personally tried is the fact that it has dual baskets separated by a center divider, meaning you can whip up two separate dishes using two different cooking methods, at the same time. You also have the option of using the entire basket for one dish if that's preferred \\u2014\\xa0just remove the center divider.The dual cooking feature makes this particular air fryer great for cooking full meals (use one side for your proteins and the other for vegetables) as well as dishes that have different cooking times (for instance, cauliflower in one basket, potatoes in the other). Each basket has a 4.5-quart capacity (enough for a family of two to four) when used in dual zones, or a nine-quart capacity when using the entire basket during single-zone use.The air fryer whipped up my Mediterranean fried egg dish beautifully \\u2014 I cracked a few eggs directly into the parchment-lined basket, threw in olives and tomatoes, and sprinkled in some cheese. I let the air fryer run for about 13 minutes and the eggs were perfectly runny and the cheese was lightly crisped.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThought-out detailsNo detail went unnoticed with this air fryer. For one, it has a nifty \"reminder\" button that you can turn on before pre-selecting your function \\u2014 this feature causes the air fryer to beep when the food is two-thirds of the way cooked to remind you to shake the basket (FYI: this works on all modes except broil, reheat, and dehydrate). I found this extremely useful, especially when hosting and having several other dishes to worry about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sync feature means your fries and chicken will be done cooking at the same time.\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\nThe air fryer also has a \"sync\" function for times you're making use of the dual zone feature. With \"sync,\" you're able to sync up two different cooking times so that all foods are ready at the same time. I used this function when cooking chicken cutlets and French fries as the potatoes needed a head start, and everything was nice and ready at the same time.Is the Drew Barrymore air fryer worth it?Aside from its useful details, this appliance is downright gorgeous. The lack of knobs and buttons gives it a sleeker look \\u2014 a plus considering its already-substantial size. It also has clean lines and comes in five different colors, including a muted blue and sage green. One thing that would be nice is if the handle hardware were available in stainless steel \\u2014 right now, it's only available in a golden-brassy finish, which won't match kitchens that don't have this shade in their design. I also like that the touchscreen light only illuminates when it needs to communicate something to you (like that your food is ready).\\xa0While the touch-activated screen is easy to use and get the hang of, sometimes it gets finicky and requires pushing the same button a few times for it to compute. Still, the air fryer is well-made, especially when it comes to the basket, which locks securely into place and flawlessly opens and closes (unlike other air fryers I've tried that require me to finagle the basket with two hands while maneuvering).\\xa0The brand claims that the air fryer can feed up to nine people, but I personally don't see how that's possible since I was only able to fit two chicken cutlets and a handful of potatoes in the dual baskets.
