            "description": " I feel extremely lost. I’m a current junior/senior expected to graduate from my undergraduate in fall 2023. My first two years in school have been in covid year so the classes were on Zoom and the assignments were easy. Most of my professors did not care about the assignments too much either. I’ve also had a huge mental health crisis and blacked out on most of the stuff that I’ve learned. It’s not an excuse but it’s more of a background to what happened and how I’m feeling. During the first couple of years, I learned the basics of Java and C++. I’ve also taken a data structure class. That class was super quick and I don’t remember much from it. I think the most we did was draw trees. There was no code involved. I’ve had two internships but they didn’t give me the valuable experience that I wanted. I’ve only done some scripting work as well as Excel work. Now I’m relearning data structures and algorithms in Python, and plan to finish it in the next week and start practicing soon. I’ve reviewed some basics of Java and over the summer I will be reviewing C++. I also have an internship this time where there’s an opportunity to grow my coding skills(I've been told I'll be working with Java and node.js).\n\nI want to get into AI/ML and I’m not sure if I can learn that concurrently. There’s also just so much technology out there and each day I feel as if I’m not good enough and I’m not learning enough. I have no idea what my plan should look like for the next couple of months. I want to get better at not only learning the language but coding (by that I mean problem-solving skills, analytical skills, and such). I’d also like to state that I can solve coding problems to a certain extent. I don’t think I am absolutely horrible, I think I might describe myself as average or a little below average. But I want to be better.\n\nI still feel absolutely horrible. I feel like everything around me is moving at such a fast pace. Some people around me are way advanced and I’d like to get there. It starting to feel a little unreachable and I’m worried I’m going to lose any motivation I have. I’m now kind of having a crisis thinking about my career. I would love some input on what I can look into for studying, getting better at problem-solving, and how I get over this feeling when everything around me moves at a faster pace. Are there any good AI/ML programs I can do concurrently so I'm not behind? What would you say is the probability that I miserably fail and don't get a full-time job after graduation lol?",

I switched major at the end of freshman year, so I started taking computer science classes at the beginning of the sophomore year. My school's cs ranking is around #30 but that hasn't helped me much at all. I've been applying to internships since about mid-september last year(applied about 300 total companies). I've only had 4 interviews and none of them panned out. Some companies said they would be interviewing me but ended up telling me that \"due to the current economic and company priorities, this internship position have been closed\"\n\nThis is kind of the first test of my skills/experience isn't it? I imagine applying for a job will be similar. If I'm not getting in now, what do I need to change to get a job next year?\n\nI've read that doing personal projects and working on open source helps a bit but can it really replace an internship? Is it possible recruiters will wonder why I don't have an internship on my resume?\n\nSide note: Is it still possible to land an internship position for summer? I know its really late but is there any advice specific to getting a last-minute position somewhere?",

We're in southern California so UCSB is the least expensive option, but we can afford the others, and my wife and I think there's some value in getting a little further away from home. Purdue seems to have the most highly regarded program for CS, but we've heard that a significant fraction of students don't continue past the first year, and that the 4 year graduation rate is only \\~50%. My son isn't a quitter and works hard, but at the same time, he's not 100% sure that he wants to do CS, and we're worried the program at Purdue might be more likely to discourage him. We're also concerned that Purdue's reputation is primarily in STEM, and if he decides to to something else, he may be better off at one of the other schools.\n\nWe don't know much about UF, but from the information we can find, it looks like a reasonable balance (USNews top 50 in CS, top 30 overall) and the weather in Gainesville is probably more comfortable for a kid from southern California. My wife and I both went to college in Boston, so we have a weakness for BU, but it's easily the most expensive option, and not as highly ranked as some of his other choices. Still, it's a slightly smaller private school, so we think it might be easier for him to explore things there (don't have to declare a major until 2nd semester sophomore year), and our sense is that it's more selective and more of a \"name\" school.\n\nUCSB would be the \"easy\" option, but again, we do worry that he'll miss out on something by staying too close to home.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, we'd be appreciative.\n\nThanks.",

I have a bad math background, have only taken discrete math but am willing to work on my math skills and build a stronger foundation in stats. \n\nHow useful would this minor be for me as a SWE? Any edge it gives me? Or is it pointless and the major is enough?",

            "description": "I'm currently a sophomore and I had originally planned to graduate early, in three years because I had 18 credits coming in and  did 9 credits over my freshman summer. I'm going to end this semester with 96 credits and I only need 126 to graduate, so I can graduate early by just taking 15 credits my next two semesters.\n\nHowever, I was unable to secure a relevant internship this summer (got a biz ops intern for now, still trying) after 1200+ applications. I had an offer in January that got rescinded, have a few interviews liked up but mainly for data analyst/science. Is it unwise to still go ahead to graduate early?\n\nI'm international and although my parents are willing to pay for me to stay the full 4 years, I would still prefer not to spend so much on college, so currently I'm thinking about graduating a semester early and just underload my last semester so I still save a good amount of money. Is that a better idea and what do you all think?",

Combine with being an international student, there are levels of anxiety hitting me rn. I know that I still have lots of time, but this field is very competitive, and I can't help but feeling peer pressures from other successful CS students. The CC doesn't have many opportunities for networking, and competing (not even a CS club), or career fairs. Currently, I am going to finish a course about OOP in Java, but I have messed around and know a little bit about making web apps (APIs, NodeJS, OOP in JS, ReactJS), also halfway through freeCodeCamp's JS Algorithms and Data Structures course. \n\nI want to ask anyone who had gone to a Community College what did you do during your school years and the summers, and is there any remote opportunities that you guys found helpful for a CS freshman (except for bootcamps)?",

I'm worried that this will negatively affect how my resume looks when I'm applying to internships for next year. I currently have a leadership role for a high school role on there, but I've heard it looks bad to keep high school activities on your resume when you aren't a freshman. Also, I'm a little worried that getting rejected from these roles is a sign that I wouldn't be qualified to take on internships/extra responsibilities outside of classwork.\n\nAnyone have any general/anecdotal advice for how this would affect my chances? Also, I know it's not super necessary/likely to get an internship my second year, but it has been a big personal goal of mine and I also like having something to do over the summer!",

            "description": "Say you were building a chatGPT plugin with a set of endpoints, relevant descriptions and docs etc in a manifest file. But you also wanted to use this plugin internally for your own pipeline (not just natively in chatGPT, say you want to add a Q&A to your website using GPT API). \n\nYou would need a prompt that interprets the manifest file given the user question to decide which endpoints to use and write the requests. The responses would then be fed as context to a second GPT call to answer the question.\n\nRegarding the first step (interpreting the manifest and writing an endpoint request):\n\n1. Does anyone know whether openAI is doing this step with a specialized model, or simply a prompt template for GPT?\n2. Given such a specialized model isn't publicly exposed regardless, has anyone seen examples of a prompt that can do this reliably, or have ideas on how to structure it? Would you replicate the manifest format or specialize your own? Would you need to fine-tune to get reliably usable responses? Has anyone tried this? Is some progress from langchain relevant?",

Spending all day non-stop where to get those muscles doing overtime. Appreciates his source of energy from Glenda the greasy spoons owner and part time waitress. \nAnd he never gains an ounce of fat upon his body. Unless to count for that one off brief moment of Glenda's fat thighs wrapping around his waist round the back of her café.\n\nIn comparison, to a lazy gobshite who blames his glands for being obese. Never done a hard day's paid work, apart from the short-lived lollipop role to play, but had to leave that only job to ever do from sweat compulsions, for going too long without eating a chocolate bar. \nAlso eats each given morning that same fry-up for breakfast as the forementioned. \nOnly to complain not to have enough sausages and bacon on the plate. Can see from the flabby arse overhanging the seat have eaten far too many meals already. \nCompliments all the same for a satisfying hearty breakfast. (he won't be seeing Glenda's thighs though, that's for sure). \nWobbles off back home, where was too lazy to cook himself. Parks his oversized rear on a chair that is purposely made for 3 to sit on. \nFlicks on the telly where to get another days worth of wasted education to absorb. While scoffing the cupboards worth of a weeks shop in sweets, crisps, and anyother snackable item to digest. \nAnd then blames Glenda's kindness for that trapped wind so desperately to pass out from either end. \n\nThen, the dietary expert enters the room and guess which role model to use for giving sound advice on a healthy lifestyle to achieve?\n\nWhen there was one really to be had anyway.",

When it was handed to me, I immediately notice its a 16oz cup and not a 32oz as it was just a couple of weeks ago. I about said something thinking they got my order wrong, till I noticed some symbols on the bottom of the cup, noting the cup to be \"large for soft drinks, medium for shakes''\n\nThey're downsizing all their shake sizes. The real kicker though? The price of a large, despite them literally giving you half as much now, is just as much as it was a couple weeks ago when it was a 32oz. This is AFTER they already increased prices throughout the past year like everyone else because \"inflation\". \n\nIt's bad enough that everywhere is constantly raising prices, but now these guys are trying to give me HALF AS MUCH for the same price?\n\nNah. Aint going to Sonic ever again. You shouldn't either. Plenty of other places with 32oz or larger shakes for roughly the same price.",
