I found out that it was Google's Foobar challenge.\n\nI requested the first problem and I am given some time to solve it.\n\nI wanted to know that is it possible to only request problems when I know enough? Like can I solve the first one, gather enough knowledge over the summer and then try?\n\nI don't wanna let it go to waste. And I am just a freshman, who currently only knows to implement binary search(that too in C++)\n\nAll the questions there require python or Java.\n\nI'd be grateful to get your advice.",

            "description": "Hello, I am in a dilemma. I am 24M. I never knew what I wanted to do in life but I was always into computers. I got a diploma in Biotechnology that I never used. In 2021 I finally got serious and gave Coding a go and ended up liking it. Studied on my own for a year and a half and started applying for jobs. I did a few interviews but didn't land a position and then the whole tech job market started to go down.\n\nLost hope after almost getting a position and getting rejected suddenly without any reason. After that, I did not study anything for 3-4 months. Now I am trying to get back to it (working on DS and Algo also learning node) but my motivation is not the same.\n\nI have a lot of doubt, especially after watching students with degrees struggling to land a job. I also sometimes feel like the last two years will be wasted if I quit now.\n\nI am considering going back to college like Centennial or Seneca for a 2-3 year college diploma or maybe a degree in some university if I can get into imagining that will increase my chances in the future. Also, I will have a chance to get some internships which I don't even get considered for right now as they are only for students. Will that be the correct step or I should keep learning on my own?\n\nI also work full-time. So, I will probably have to go part-time to go to college too which is going to be hard (I hate this job tbh but it pays my bills).",

I am pretty close to finishing my marketing degree (6 marketing classes left) but I feel like if I were to drop marketing I could register for more cs electives or work on more personal projects.\n\nThe main reason I am reluctant to drop marketing is that I am pretty close to finishing it, considering the number of classes I have taken to fulfill that degree. Also, there might be a chance that having a marketing degree on my resume could be advantageous in the future.\n\nWhat do yall think?",

I'm terribly sorry if this sounds like a college comparison post or something. I just didn't know who else to ask. \n\nI've been accepted into few colleges UMD, GMU, and VCU. The thing I'd really like to join UMD, but the costs are pretty expensive. 180K for 3 Years (Using AP/DE Credits to Take Away a Year). I think my parents can afford it (Our household income is >250k. (They're also CS people)). I've the same hopes as pretty much as all of you (Found/Join a Startup, Become a Quant, Join FAANG). I've already committed to UMD. However, I've realized I can still join CC (but I'll lost my deposit). I know that my goals may not reachable and might rather aim for a Masters/PhD in a field like ML or Mathematical Finance at a T20 University. So I think CC might be a better option at this point since I'd be able to save more money.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I know that I'm sacrificing a lot of opportunities (Freshman FAANG opportunities) an some other stuff. How was your experience at CC as a CS Major? How else would I lose opportunities?\n\nAgain, I'm sorry since this is technically a college comparison post (I've just realized this when I was 75% through). And if you can, instead of saying something like spending that much money on a college is not worth it, can you say why you think spending that much money isn't worth it?",

Most of my best leads I made through smiles and shaking hands. Once the interviews started then I got a chance to show on a deeper level my skills, but that in person contact is invaluable. Go to your schools career fairs people! You'll get way better response rates, and you might meet a recruiter that goes to bat for you.",

I just completed the final round of interviews last Friday and now I'm waiting to hear back.\n\nCurrently, I don't have anything lined up and I'm extremely stressed to not find anything. AMD just wrote to me today and rejected me.\n\nI worked at a company called Travelport the last 2 summers and could possibly reach out to my hiring manager and line something up if I don't find anything else. The experience was valuable, so I definitely wouldn't mind going back. Would probably do full stack or data engineering if I went back. Haven't reached out because I just wanted to try something new this summer, and Yahoo is just a bigger company.\n\nMy dilemma is that maybe I get Yahoo back, but I already asked for a position at Travelport, then my hiring manager went through all the trouble of prepping for me just to blow him off. I feel like if I do this, I'd be basically cutting off my connections with him and Travelport. I know, I shouldn't have waited this long to reach out, but I'm basically scrambling now.\n\nWhat should I do? If I got both, which should I take? Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.",

No OA, no take home assignment, just behavioral + technical. Arm was HireVue (more on technical side though) + technical interview.\n\nPS: On alt account\n\nEdit: Formatting + adding information about processes for each\n\nEdit: Would the C++ skills not be useful for applying to trading/HFT firms next year? Jump Trading, HRT and Optiver come to mind\n\nAnother edit: I also think US people here have a different view of cloudflare because of how much harder the process is there. I only have 2 rounds, one behavioral, one technical. Sorry for so many edits, it's my first internship and obviously feeling nervous  \n\n\nThe team i'm in at Cloudflare is not very low level based which I know HFT firms like, whereas Arm is about architecture and hardware.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12r524h)",

            "description": "I currently have two summer internship offers. They both aren't FAANG-level companies, but have decent pay (Company A: $42+corporate housing, Company B: $48/hr+$2500/mo housing stipend). I originally planned on reneging A after I made sure that B didn't rescind me because A somehow has a terrible reputation in the field and is known to have \"legacy tech\" that isn't very applicable outside of the company. I didn't want to return there as a full-time either since there are a lot of horror stories about how they grind and burn out their new grads. A is also located in the midwest while B is a unicorn startup in San Francisco (but is struggling a bit because of the recession and recently had layoffs).\n\nHowever, I just got notified of what my project will be for Company A today, and it appears that they have placed me in an ML team for their software which works with Python and time-series data. Now, I'm contemplating whether I should ask B to delay my start date since they offer Fall/Winter internships and I feel like ML internship opportunities are much harder to come by, especially for someone like me who has little research experience. My work at B is more related to low-level systems, like OS and IoT/embedded, with opportunities to work with Android app development if I want.\n\nUnfortunately, if B does let me move the start date, it would mean that I have to delay my graduation date by a semester. I definitely would have done so if one or both companies were FAANG level in terms of technology and prestige, but I'm not sure if doing delaying graduation for non-FAANG companies will ultimately be beneficial for me. I'm currently a Junior with no previous internship experience, so I originally planned on doing the fifth-year master's program offered at my university, which will let me get an MS and also get in another summer internship before going full time. If I take the semester off, I probably will not have the time to spend another year in education (I would still get another summer to find internships though). I'm not sure which one would be a better investment overall.\n\n**TL;DR:** I have two non-FAANG internship offers. Planned on reneging one because the other company seemed better overall, but just got assigned to an ML project that looks interesting. Now, I'm considering about asking to push back one of the internship to Fall so I can do both, but it means I graduate late + I can't do 5th master's that I was potentially considering.",

Therefore, with this mindset I didn’t pay much attention to Physics 1 and Calculus 1. I thought these subjects weren’t going to help me at all. And here I am in my second semester with subjects of Calculus 2 and Physics 2 and also Differential Equations. I have almost forgot the previous semester’s subjects and after reading some comments on the internet, I have come to the conclusion that Computer Science is not all about programming and I want to take all the steps necessary to become an educated person in the field of Computer Science. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or resources that I should study to study Math and Physics related subjects that is a must for a Computer Science student?",

            "description": "I'm also a new grad myself and I sympathize with yall who are feeling defeated with the job search. I've been there, trust me. I was applying since July 2022 and didn't land a job offer until February. I managed to land 2 job offers as a swe @ big firms non-faang before I graduate.  Here's my advice. If you currently don't have internships, make sure you find one or create one yourself by doing freelance work or something. I did had irrelevant internships that were non-swe related by the time I got to my junior year. I managed to get a swe part-time internship at a garbage startup during the school year that paid peanuts but that landed me a better, higher paying internship for the following summer. Now, times have changed now due to massive layoffs and greater competition so entry-level swe jobs are more competitive than ever before. Guess what? You just need to make yourself competitive by equipping yourself with more knowledge + experience. Companies nowadays expect you to have a lot of experience as an entry-level so whether you like it or not that's just the game you have to play to get that good paying job. I think networking helps too but honestly you are better off just cold-applying since cold-applying can increase your chances of landing a position. I did not network. I just cold applied and managed to get a solid TC for swe role. All you have to do is grind and apply because everyone else around you is chasing the same job.",
