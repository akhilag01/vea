Measures adopted under the\u00a0Digital Services Act\u00a0(DSA) call for\u00a0algorithmic accountability and transparency audits.The ECAT contributes with scientific and technical expertise to the European Commission's exclusive\u00a0supervisory and enforcement role\u00a0of the systemic obligations on Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) provided for under the DSA.Scientists and experts working at the ECAT will cooperate with industry representatives, academia, and\u00a0civil society\u00a0organisations to\u00a0improve our understanding of how algorithms work: they will analyse\u00a0transparency,\u00a0assess\u00a0risks, and propose\u00a0new transparent approaches\u00a0and best practices.The ECAT is part of the\u00a0European Commission, hosted by the\u00a0Joint Research Centre\u00a0(JRC)\u00a0- the Commission\u2019s in-house science and knowledge service - in close cooperation with\u00a0the Directorate General Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT).\n\n\n\n\n\u200e\u2002\u2002Watch the recording\n\n\n\n\nWe are preparing new rounds of recruitment for top-level experts\u00a0interested in research or inspection.\u00a0In the meantime, you can send a spontaneous application to\u00a0EC-ECAT@ec.europa.eu, and if your profile matches our needs we will keep you updated once new positions are available on the\u00a0JRC Recruitment Portal.\u00a0Visit our recruitment section for updates\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn the spotlight\nPress release16 November 2022Digital Services Act: EU's landmark rules for online platforms enter into forceThe\u00a0Digital Services Act\u00a0(DSA)\u00a0creates an unprecedented level of public oversight of online platforms across the Union, both at national and EU level.Questions and answers10 November 2022Q&A: Digital Services ActFind general information about the Digital Services Act (DSA), as well as details about its impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nECAT in the media\nNews announcement20 February 2023Contraintes par Bruxelles, les plateformes d\u00e9voilent leurs audiences en EuropeECAT news announcement published on Le Figaro, France.News announcement16 November 2022Landmark EU rules for online platforms enter into forceECAT news announcement published on EU business, Belgium.News announcement15 November 2022Sevilla albergar\u00e1 el Centro Europeo para la Transparencia algor\u00edtmicaECAT news announcement published on El Pa\u00eds, Spain.See all\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated contentThe Digital Services Act packageThe Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act aim to create a safer digital space where the fundamental rights of users are protected and to establish a level playing field for businesses.Trustworthy AI @ JRCA summary to all the activities of the Joint Research Centre towards a trustworthy artificial intelligence: transparent, fair, human-centred and with a positive societal impact.\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Centre for Algorithmic TransparencyThis site is managed by the Joint Research CentreMore information on:Research and innovationContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResources for partnersLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.edsurge.com/", "title": "EdSurge Articles", "pubDate": "null", "id_field": "03f78149-46f5-4e8a-943d-48b0f934b209", "feed_link": "null", "embed_text": "EdSurge Articles", "feed_title": "null", "image_link": "null", "description": "null", "article": "your version of IE browser is not supported please upgrade.<![else]--><![endif]-->"}, {"link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYsDfGASWV4", "title": "Drake and The Weeknd song created by AI including voices", "pubDate": "null", "id_field": "03c9ac0b-8aa5-4590-a0df-10ae5244c3d4", "feed_link": "null", "embed_text": "Drake and The Weeknd song created by AI including voices", "feed_title": "null", "image_link": "null", "description": "null", "article": " -

It helps export conversations, search conversations, and visualize stats about your conversations.\nInstallation\nTo install the application, check out the releases tab and download the app for your architecture. https://github.com/jonluca/mimessage/releases\nFeatures\nThis alternative UI provides several advanced features, including:\n\nSemantic Search: Using OpenAI and a locally running version of chroma you can do semantic search on your messages\nWrapped: See the stats for all your iMessage conversations\nCustom Filters: Apply custom filters to refine your search results and find exactly what you're looking for.\nCustom Filters: Apply custom filters to refine your search results and find exactly what you're looking for.\nConversation Export: Export all the data of a given conversation in a user-friendly format for archival purposes or analysis.\nRegex Search: Search your conversations using powerful regular expressions to find specific messages or patterns.\nMedia Export: Easily export all media (images, videos, etc.) from a conversation to a separate folder.\nAI Conversation: Have a conversation with anyone you've talked to before, in their voice\n\nPlease note that this application is for viewing and managing iMessage conversations only. It does NOT allow you to send messages.\n\nWrapped\nMimessage also creates an \"iMessage Wrapped\" - a Spotify Wrapped, but for your conversations. It will generate some statistics about your conversations.\n\nFun sidenote: ChatGPT actually came up with a lot of the stats that would be interesting to see.\n\nMy stats look wrong\nIf a lot of your conversations are missing attachments, or the stats look wrong, you can try the following:\n\nOpen up iMessage settings\nUnselect \"Enable Messages in iCloud\"\nIn the prompt, select \"Only this device\"\nRe-enable Messages in iCloud\nWait for the messages to sync and download (You can see progress in the bottom right of the iMessage app)\n\nThis will force iMessage to download all the attachments and messages to your computer. This process might take a while depending on how many messages you have.\nCreating embedding is slow\nThe OpenAI rate limits are dependent on your tier and account age. Make sure you're on the \"Pay as you go\" plan, and your acount is at least 48 hours old.\nDeveloping\nFirst clone the repo, then run yarn to install dependencies. Then run yarn dev to start the application.\nThe recommended node version is v19\ngit clone git@github.com:jonluca/mimessage.git\ncd mimessage\nyarn install\nyarn dev\nImportant note: your IDE or your terminal must have full disk access enabled in permissions. It will also request contacts permissions, to be able to read your contacts to map the phone numbers to names.\nCredits\n\nimessage-exporter was used to help understand the database schema\nBlueBubbles was used to understand some messages specific types and enums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n      iMessage Wrapped, Semantic Search, and AI Chats\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nblog.jonlu.ca/posts/mimessage?ref=gh\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n        Readme\n \n\n\nStars\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n    stars\n\nWatchers\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n    watching\n\nForks\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n    forks\n\n\n\n        Report repository\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Releases\n      25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv1.0.12\n\n          Latest\n \nApr 19, 2023\n\n \n\n        + 24 releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Packages 0\n\n\n        No packages published \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeScript\n96.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS\n3.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript\n0.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \u00a9 2023 GitHub, Inc.\n        \n\n\n\nFooter navigation\n\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact GitHub\nPricing\nAPI\nTraining\nBlog\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    You can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n  \n\n\n\n\nYou signed in with another tab or window.
