Measures adopted under the\u00a0Digital Services Act\u00a0(DSA) call for\u00a0algorithmic accountability and transparency audits.The ECAT contributes with scientific and technical expertise to the European Commission's exclusive\u00a0supervisory and enforcement role\u00a0of the systemic obligations on Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) provided for under the DSA.Scientists and experts working at the ECAT will cooperate with industry representatives, academia, and\u00a0civil society\u00a0organisations to\u00a0improve our understanding of how algorithms work: they will analyse\u00a0transparency,\u00a0assess\u00a0risks, and propose\u00a0new transparent approaches\u00a0and best practices.The ECAT is part of the\u00a0European Commission, hosted by the\u00a0Joint Research Centre\u00a0(JRC)\u00a0- the Commission\u2019s in-house science and knowledge service - in close cooperation with\u00a0the Directorate General Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT).\n\n\n\n\n\u200e\u2002\u2002Watch the recording\n\n\n\n\nWe are preparing new rounds of recruitment for top-level experts\u00a0interested in research or
