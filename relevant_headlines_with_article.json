Since 2014, their domestic market share has risen from around 1 percent to around 6 percent. The Biden administration has far bigger plans for the next eight years: Under a sweeping set of vehicle emissions rules unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, EVs would make up as much as two-thirds of all U.S. car sales by 2031 \u2014 a more than tenfold increase from current levels.AdvertisementThe EPA\u2019s new pollution standards target conventional passenger cars, vans, and pickup trucks. They set much stricter emission limits for planet-warming gasses like carbon dioxide and methane as well as toxic pollutants like nitrogen oxide. When the vehicle emissions rules take effect, new automobiles will be allowed to spew less than half as much carbon as they can now. A separate set of rules will limit carbon emissions from larger heavy-duty trucks.In theory, auto manufacturers can choose how they achieve compliance, but the EPA believes many of them will opt to manufacture EVs rather than trying to design combustion vehicles that meet the new standards. Automakers like Ford and General Motors have already claimed they plan to phase out production of gasoline-powered cars, but these rules would speed up their timelines. If they work as designed, the regulations would avert the equivalent of more than two full years of current U.S. carbon emissions.12% offLEGO Star Wars Ultimate Millennium FalconBuild the largest LEGO Millennium Falcon to dateIncludes two crews of minifigures - 4 classic crew minifigures: Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia and C-3PO, plus 3 Star Wars Episode VII/VIII crew minifigures: Older Han Solo, Rey and FinnBuy for $747 at AmazonAdvertisementAdvertisementBut that\u2019s a big \u201cif.\u201dAssuming the new rules survive inevitable legal challenges from Republican-led states, manufacturing and selling that many new electric cars will require an industrial buildout unprecedented in scale and speed, not to mention millions more tons of critical minerals like lithium and cobalt. The rules are some of the most ambitious climate regulations in U.S. history, but it will take a Herculean effort from the American automotive industry to comply \u2014 well beyond the industry\u2019s recent investments and the incentives included in the historic climate law Congress passed last summer.Advertisement\u201cThe momentum is already building for the adoption of EVs,\u201d said Ellen Kennedy, who leads the carbon-free transportation program at RMI, a think tank focused on sustainability. \u201cWe\u2019ve had just extraordinary growth with regard to EV infrastructure and chargers. We need a lot more in order to be ready for the projected demand that would stem from adoption of a rulemaking like this.\u201dAutomakers and battery manufacturers will have to build new plants, source new minerals from around the world, and hire and train thousands more workers, according to Kennedy. Many of them are already doing this, but \u201cthey need to do more of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she added.AdvertisementThere\u2019s also the matter of charging stations. The U.S. currently needs at least 2 million additional charging stations to support new EVs as they hit the road, or about 8 times as many as exist right now. The EPA\u2019s standards will only increase that need if they spur the growth in the market that\u2019s intended. Lack of available charging infrastructure is already the number-one concern that keeps Americans from purchasing an EV.And for EV adoption to reduce emissions, the electricity in those charging stations will need to get cleaner. Last year saw renewables surpass coal in terms of electricity generated in the U.S. for the first time, but a glut of new EVs could strain the power grid and force utilities to burn more natural gas. The EPA\u2019s modeling admits such a ramp-up is likely but says \u201cthose projected impacts decrease over time because of projected increases in renewables,\u201d so that vehicle carbon emissions would fall 47 percent from current levels by 2055.AdvertisementThe final concern is price. While EVs have dropped in price over the past decade and are approaching cost parity with some combustion vehicles, they are still unaffordable for many Americans, especially those in disadvantaged communities \u2014 who often live in what environmental justice activists call \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d The EPA said that its new vehicle emissions rules would likely raise average prices for both new and used vehicles of all types, but it also said that EV consumers would save money on gasoline and maintenance, which might offset the price increase.These price concerns persist in spite of the EV tax credits included in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which may not be as transformative as lawmakers hoped: Because the tax credits require automakers to source minerals and battery parts from within the U.S., many models won\u2019t be eligible until the U.S. completes the yearslong process of building a domestic supply chain.AdvertisementKennedy said that in addition to helping in the climate fight, the rulemaking will have a transformative impact for public health. Tailpipe emissions are the leading cause of pollution in many cities, and tens of millions of people experience negative health effects from automobile pollution.\u201cThere\u2019s such a connection between transportation, air quality, and public health,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cThis is an area where we can really go to work on goals about inequality and health. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201dAdvertisementThis article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/transportation/biden-epa-vehicle-emissions-rules-electric/.

They will enforce distance requirements to make sure no one comes close to the former president. His detail will be with him as he is processed, fingerprinted and photographed for mug shots.At this point, the former president isn\u2019t expected to be handcuffed as he will be surrounded by armed federal agents for his protection.\u00a0\u00a0share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:41 p.m. ET, March 31, 2023Trump is expected to be arraigned in Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon, sources sayFrom CNN's Gloria Pazmino and Lauren Del ValleFormer President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned in Manhattan criminal court around 2:15 p.m. ET Tuesday, two sources with knowledge of the matter tell CNN.Officials involved in the planning of Trump's appearance are considering pausing all other case activity at the court during the time that the former president is expected to appear, according to a source with knowledge of the plans.An adjournment of all other matters at the courthouse\u00a0Tuesday afternoon\u00a0would reduce the amount of foot traffic in the building for security reasons, the source said.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link6:00 p.m. ET, March 31, 2023Trump will travel to New York on Monday ahead of court appearance on Tuesday, sources sayFrom CNN's Alayna TreeneSeen through a security fence, the Trump Organization's Boeing 757 used by former U.S. President Donald Trump, known as Trump Force One, sits parked on the tarmac at the Palm Beach International Airport on March 31 in West Palm Beach, Florida.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Former President Donald\u00a0Trump lashed out online at the judge he is expected to appear before Tuesday, accusing Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan\u00a0of \u201crailroading\u201d former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg in a previous case.Calling the allegations against him a \"Witch Hunt Case,\" Trump claimed in a Truth Social post that the judge \"HATES\" him.Merchan is the \"same person who 'railroaded' my 75 year old former CFO, Allen Weisselberg, to take a 'plea' deal,\" Trump wrote.\u201cHe strong armed Allen, which a judge is not allowed to do, & treated my companies, which didn't 'plead,' VICIOUSLY,\" the former president added.Some context: Merchan\u00a0oversaw the criminal tax fraud case against\u00a0Weisselberg\u00a0and two Trump Organization entities.\u00a0Weisselberg\u00a0pleaded guilty and\u00a0Merchan\u00a0approved his plea deal, under which\u00a0Weisselberg\u00a0would serve five months in jail if he pleaded guilty to 15 felonies and testified truthfully at the trial of the Trump companies. Weisselberg is expected to be released from Rikers Island next month.The judge warned Weisselberg at his guilty pleas that he could face up to 15 years in prison if he deviated from this agreement.At sentencing, Merchan said he found it \"offensive\" that\u00a0Weisselberg fabricated a paycheck so his wife could receive federal benefits and wished he could have sentenced him to \"a much greater\" sentence.During the investigation, the\u00a0judge held the Trump entities in criminal contempt and fined them $4,000 for failing to comply with multiple grand jury subpoenas. The judge kept his ruling under seal until after the verdict so it wouldn't prejudice the case. The Trump entities were found guilty of multiple counts of tax fraud and falsifying business records. The judge handed down the maximum sentence, a fine of $1.6 million.\u00a0share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:16 p.m. ET, March 31, 2023Pence says Trump indictment will \"only serve to further divide\" the USFrom CNN's Veronica StracqualursiFormer Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the National Review Institute summit on Friday, March 31.
